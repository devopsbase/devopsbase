    A chef-client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is under
    management by Chef. It can run in local mode (successor of chef-solo). This allows
    all commands that work against the Chef server to also work against the local
    chef-repo.

    Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that
    makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or
    cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. Each organization is
    comprised of one (or more) workstations, a single server, and every node that
    will be configured and maintained by the chef-client. Cookbooks (and recipes)
    are used to tell the chef-client how each node in your organization should be
    configured. The chef-client (which is installed on every node) does the actual
    configuration.

    Test Kitchen is a test harness tool to execute your configured code on one or more platforms in isolation. A driver plugin architecture is used which lets you run your code on various cloud providers and virtualization technologies such as Amazon EC2, Blue Box, CloudStack, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, OpenStack, Vagrant, Docker, LXC containers, and more. Many testing frameworks are already supported out of the box including Bats, shUnit2, RSpec, Serverspec, with others being created weekly.

    For Chef workflows, cookbook dependency resolver tools such as Berkshelf and Librarian-Chef are supported or you can simply have a cookbooks directory and Test Kitchen will know what to do. Support for Test Kitchen is already included in many Chef community cookbooks such as the MySQL, nginx, Chef Server, and runit cookbooks.
