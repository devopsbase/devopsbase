description: Uniform API that abstracts the differences between clouds
readme: |
  Deltacloud provides the API server and drivers necessary for connecting to cloud providers.
  Deltacloud maintains long-term stability for scripts, tools and applications and backward compatibility across different versions.
  Deltacloud enables management of resources in different clouds by the use of one of three supported APIs. The supported APIs are the Deltacloud classic API, the DMTF CIMI API or even the EC2 API.
  All of this means you can start an instance on an internal cloud and with the same code start another on EC2 or RHEV-M.
