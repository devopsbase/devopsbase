  - Docker
  description: At the core of the Docker platform is Docker Engine, a lightweight runtime and robust tooling that builds and runs your Docker containers. Docker Engine runs on Linux to create the operating environment for your distributed applications. The in-host daemon communicates with the Docker client to execute commands to build, ship and run containers.

  description: Kitematic is the fastest and easiest way to start using Docker on your laptop. A completely automated process installs and configures the Docker environment on your machine in just minutes. Build and run containers through a simple, yet powerful graphical user interface (GUI).

  description: To get started with Docker, first you need to setup a Docker Engine. Docker Machine automatically sets up Docker on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your data center. Docker Machine provisions the hosts, installs Docker Engine on them, and then configures the Docker client to talk to the Docker Engines.

  - Cluster Management
  description: The nature of distributed applications requires compute resources that are also distributed. Docker Swarm provides native clustering capabilities to turn a group of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker Engine. With these pooled resources, you can scale out your application as if it were running on a single, huge computer.
- name: Docker Compose

  labels:
  - CLI
  - Docker
  description: Distributed applications consist of many small applications that work together. Docker transforms these applications into individual containers that are linked together. Instead of having to build, run and manage each individual container, Docker Compose allows you to define your multi-container application with all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command. Your applicationâ€™s structure and configuration are held in a single place, which makes spinning up applications simple and repeatable everywhere.
