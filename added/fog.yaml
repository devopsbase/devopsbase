  readme: |
    Whether you need compute, dns, storage, or a multitude of other services, fog provides an accessible entry point and facilitates cross service compatibility.

    Just getting started working with cloud resources? You are not alone, and having so many complicated options makes it hard to know where to start. fog delivers the knowledge of cloud experts to you, helping you to bootstrap your cloud usage and guiding you as your own expertise develops.

    By coding with fog from the start you avoid vendor lock-in and give yourself more flexibility to provide value. Whether you are writing a library, designing a software as a service product or just hacking on the weekend this flexibility is a huge boon.

    With a rapidly expanding community and codebase the advantages of fog just keep coming. Join us and together we will realize the future of cloud computing.

    Prerequisites:
    Fog recommends using MRI 1.9.3 or 2.0.0. MRI 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 are still supported by the Fog community, but are no longer supported by the Ruby community at large. While not officially supported, Fog has been known to work with Ruby Enterprise Edition, Rubinus and JRuby.
