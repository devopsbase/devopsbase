You can use\nhaproxy just like this, but typically in a production service you would\nfrontend this service with apache2 to handle the SSL negotiation, etc.  See\nthe \"Website Relation\" section for more information about that.\n\nWhen your charm hooks into reverseproxy you have two general approaches\nwhich can be used to notify haproxy about what services you are running.\n1) Single-service proxying or 2) Multi-service or relation-driven proxying.\n\n1. Single-Service Proxying\n\nIn this case, your website relation will join underneath a single `listen`\nstanza in haproxy.  This stanza will have one `service` entry for each unit\nconnecting. By convention, this is typically called \"website\".  The\nfollowing is an example of a relation-joined or changed hook:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # hooks/website-relation-joined\n\n    relation-set \"hostname=$(unit-get private-address)\"\n    relation-set \"port=80\"\n\n    # Set an optional service name, allowing more config-based\n    # customization\n    relation-set \"service_name=my_web_app\"\n\nIf you set the `service_name` relation setting, the configuration `services`\nyaml mapping will be consulted to lookup 3 other options based on service\nname.\n\n  * `{service_name}_servers` - sets the `server` line in the listen stanza\n    explicitly.\n  * `{service_name}_server_options` - Will append to the charm-generated\n    server line for for each joining unit in the reverseproxy relation.\n  * `{service_name}_service_options` - expected to be a list of strings.  Will\n    set each item as an option under the listen stanza.\n\n\n2. Relation-Driven Proxying \n\nIn this relation style, your charm should specify these relation settings\ndirectly as relation variables when joining reverseproxy.  Your charm's\nwebsite-relation-changed hook would look something like this:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # hooks/website-relation-changed\n\n    host=$(unit-get private-address)\n    port=80\n\n    relation-set \"services=\n    - { service_name: my_web_app,\n        service_options: [mode http, balance leastconn],\n        servers: [[my_web_app_1, $host, $port, option httpchk GET / HTTP/1.0],\n                  [... optionally more servers here ...]]}\n    - { ... optionally more services here ... }\n    \"\n\nOnce set, haproxy will union multiple `servers` stanzas from any units\njoining with the same `service_name` under one listen stanza.\n`service-options` and `server_options` will be overwritten, so ensure they\nare set uniformly on all services with the same name.\n\n## Website Relation\n\n\nThe website relation is the other side of haproxy.  It can communicate with\ncharms written like apache2 that can act as a front-end for haproxy to take of\nthings like ssl encryption.  When joining a service like apache2 on its\nreverseproxy relation, haproxy's website relation will set an `all_services`\nvaraible that conforms to the spec layed out in the apache2 charm.\n\nThese settings can then be used when crafting your vhost template to make sure\ntraffic goes to the correct haproxy listener which will in turn forward the\ntraffic to the correct backend server/port\n\n## Development\n\nThe following steps are needed for testing and development of the charm,\nbut **not** for deployment:\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cjohnston/flake8\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install python-mock python-flake8 python-nose python-nosexcover python-testtools charm-tools\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n    make build\n\n... will run the unit tests, run flake8 over the source to warn about\nformatting issues and output a code coverage summary of the 'hooks.py' module.\n\n\n## Known Limitations and Issues\n\n- Expand Single-Service section as I have not tested that mode fully.\n- Trigger website-relation-changed when the reverse-proxy relation changes\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nMany of the haproxy settings can be altered via the standard juju configuration\nsettings.  Please see the config.yaml file as each is fairly clearly documented.\n\n## statsd\n\nThis charm supports sending metrics to statsd.\n\nThis is done by setting config values (metrics_target being the primary one)\nto a host/port of a (UDP) statsd server.\n\nThis could instead be done using a relation, but it is common to have\none statsd server that serves multiple environments.
