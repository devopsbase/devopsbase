Learn more\nat [pig.apache.org](http://pig.apache.org).\n\nThis charm deploys the Pig component of the Apache Bigtop platform and\nsupports running Pig in two execution modes:\n\n * Local Mode: Pig runs using your local host and file system. Specify local\n   mode using the -x flag: `pig -x local`\n * Mapreduce Mode: Pig runs using a Hadoop cluster and HDFS. This is the default\n   mode; you can, optionally, specify it using the -x flag:\n   `pig` or `pig -x mapreduce`\n\n\n# Deploying / Using\n\nA working Juju installation is assumed to be present. If Juju is not yet set\nup, please follow the\n[getting-started](https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/getting-started)\ninstructions prior to deploying this charm.\n\nThis charm is intended to be used with one of the\n[apache bigtop bundles](https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-charmers/#bundles).\nFor example:\n\n    juju deploy hadoop-processing\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, use [juju-quickstart](https://launchpad.net/juju-quickstart) with the\nfollowing syntax: `juju quickstart hadoop-processing`.\n\nThis will deploy an Apache Bigtop Hadoop cluster. More information about this\ndeployment can be found in the [bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).\n\nNow add Pig and relate it to the cluster via the hadoop-plugin:\n\n    juju deploy pig\n    juju add-relation pig plugin\n\nOnce deployment is complete, Apache Pig will be available to execute Pig Latin\njobs on your data. You can run Pig in a variety of modes:\n\n## Local Mode\nRun Pig in local mode on the Pig unit with the following:\n\n    juju ssh pig/0\n    pig -x local\n\n## MapReduce Mode\nMapReduce mode is the default for Pig. To run in this mode, ssh to the Pig unit\nand run pig as follows:\n\n    juju ssh pig/0\n    pig\n\n\n# Verifying\n\n## Status\nApache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they\nare ready:\n\n    juju status\n\nThis is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going\nprogress of the deployment:\n\n    watch -n 0.5 juju status\n\nThe message column will provide information about a given unit's state.\nThis charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is\nready.\n\n## Smoke Test\nThis charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the\napplication is functioning as expected. Run the action as follows:\n\n    juju run-action pig/0 smoke-test\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action do pig/0 smoke-test`.\n\nWatch the progress of the smoke test actions with:\n\n    watch -n 0.5 juju show-action-status\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.\n\nEventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it\nreports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get\nmore information about a specific smoke test with:\n\n    juju show-action-output <action-id>\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.\n\n\n# Network-Restricted Environments\n\nCharms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy\nin this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate\nproxy and/or mirror options. See\n[Configuring Models](https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/models-config) for more\ninformation.\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\n- <bigdata@lists.ubuntu.com>\n\n\n# Resources\n\n- [Apache Bigtop](http://bigtop.apache.org/) home page\n- [Apache Bigtop issue tracking](http://bigtop.apache.org/issue-tracking.html)\n- [Apache Bigtop mailing lists](http://bigtop.apache.org/mail-lists.html)\n- [Juju Bigtop charms](https://jujucharms.com/q/apache/bigtop)\n- [Juju mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/juju)\n- [Juju community](https://jujucharms.com/community)\n",
