You can use it off-the-shelf to\nimplement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.\n\n\n## Usage\nDeploy a Zookeeper unit. With only one unit, the service will be running in\n`standalone` mode:\n\n    juju deploy apache-zookeeper zookeeper\n\n\n## Scaling\nRunning ZooKeeper in `standalone` mode is convenient for evaluation, some\ndevelopment, and testing. But in production, you should run ZooKeeper in\n`replicated` mode. A replicated group of servers in the same application is\ncalled a quorum, and in `replicated` mode, all servers in the quorum have\ncopies of the same configuration file.\n\nScaling Zookeeper to create a quorum is trivial. The following will add two\nadditional Zookeeper units and will automatically configure them with knowledge\nof the other quorum members based on their peer relation to one another:\n\n    juju add-unit -n 2 zookeeper\n\n\n## Test the deployment\nTest if the Zookeeper service is running by using the `zkServer.sh` script:\n\n    juju run --service=zookeeper '/usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh status'\n\nA successful deployment will report the service mode as either `standalone`\n(if only one Zookeeper unit has been deployed) or `leader` / `follower` (if\na Zookeeper quorum has been formed).\n\n\n## Integrate Zookeeper into another charm\n1) Add following lines to your charm's metadata.yaml:\n\n    requires:\n      zookeeper:\n         interface: zookeeper\n\n2) Add a `zookeeper-relation-changed` hook to your charm. Example contents:\n\n    from charmhelpers.core.hookenv import relation_get\n    ZK_hostname = relation_get('private-address')\n    ZK_port = relation_get('port')\n\n\n## Deploying in Network-Restricted Environments\nThis charm can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To\ndeploy in this environment, you will need a local mirror to serve the packages\nand resources required by this charm.\n\n### Mirroring Packages\nYou can setup a local mirror for apt packages using squid-deb-proxy.\nFor instructions on configuring juju to use this, see the\n[Juju Proxy Documentation](https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/howto-proxies.html).\n\n### Mirroring Resources\nIn addition to apt packages, this charm requires a few binary resources\nwhich are normally hosted on Launchpad. If access to Launchpad is not\navailable, the `jujuresources` library makes it easy to create a mirror\nof these resources:\n\n    sudo pip install jujuresources\n    juju resources fetch --all apache-zookeeper/resources.yaml -d /tmp/resources\n    juju resources serve -d /tmp/resources\n\nThis will fetch all of the resources needed by this charm and serve them via a\nsimple HTTP server.
