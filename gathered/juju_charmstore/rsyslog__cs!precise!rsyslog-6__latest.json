  "description": "reliable system and kernel logging service\n\nRsyslog is a multi-threaded implementation of syslogd (a system utility\nproviding support for message logging), with features that include:\n\n* reliable syslog over TCP, SSL/TLS and RELP\n* on-demand disk buffering\n* email alerting\n* writing to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases (via separate output plugins)\n* permitted sender lists\n* filtering on any part of the syslog message\n* on-the-wire message compression\n* fine-grained output format control\n* failover to backup destinations\n* enterprise-class encrypted syslog relaying\n\nThis is a simple rsyslogd logging server. It is most interesting\nwhen paired with the rsyslog-forwarder subordinate charm. \n",
