If Juju is not yet set\nup, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this\ncharm.\n\nThis charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].\nFor example:\n\n    juju deploy hadoop-processing\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart\nhadoop-processing`.\n\nThis will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with this charm acting as the\nResourceManager. More information about this deployment can be found in the\n[bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).\n\n## Network-Restricted Environments\nCharms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy\nin this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or\nmirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.\n\n[getting-started]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/getting-started\n[apache bigtop bundles]: https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-charmers/#bundles\n[juju-quickstart]: https://launchpad.net/juju-quickstart\n[Configuring Models]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/models-config\n\n\n# Verifying\n\n## Status\nApache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they\nare ready:\n\n    juju status\n\nThis is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going\nprogress of the deployment:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju status\n\nThe message column will provide information about a given unit's state.\nThis charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is\nready with nodemanagers.\n\n## Smoke Test\nThis charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the\napplication is functioning as expected. This action executes the 'yarn'\nsmoke tests provided by Apache Bigtop and may take up to\n10 minutes to complete. Run the action as follows:\n\n    juju run-action resourcemanager/0 smoke-test\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action do resourcemanager/0 smoke-test`.\n\nWatch the progress of the smoke test actions with:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.\n\nEventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it\nreports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get\nmore information about a specific smoke test with:\n\n    juju show-action-output <action-id>\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.\n\n## Utilities\nThis charm includes Hadoop command line and web utilities that can be used\nto verify information about the cluster.\n\nShow the running nodes on the command line with the following:\n\n    juju run --application resourcemanager \"su yarn -c 'yarn node -list'\"\n\nTo access the Resource Manager web consoles, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the\nresourcemanager application and expose it:\n\n    juju status resourcemanager\n    juju expose resourcemanager\n\nThe YARN and Job History web interfaces will be available at the following URLs:\n\n    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:8088\n    http://RESOURCEMANAGER_PUBLIC_IP:19888\n\n\n# Benchmarking\n\nThis charm provides several benchmarks to gauge the performance of the\ncluster.
