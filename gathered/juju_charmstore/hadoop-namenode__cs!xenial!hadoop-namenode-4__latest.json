If Juju is not yet set\nup, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this\ncharm.\n\nThis charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].\nFor example:\n\n    juju deploy hadoop-processing\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart\nhadoop-processing`.\n\nThis will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with this charm acting as the\nNameNode. More information about this deployment can be found in the\n[bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).\n\n## Network-Restricted Environments\nCharms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy\nin this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or\nmirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.\n\n[getting-started]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/getting-started\n[apache bigtop bundles]: https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-charmers/#bundles\n[juju-quickstart]: https://launchpad.net/juju-quickstart\n[Configuring Models]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/models-config\n\n\n# Verifying\n\n## Status\nApache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they\nare ready:\n\n    juju status\n\nThis is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going\nprogress of the deployment:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju status\n\nThe message column will provide information about a given unit's state.\nThis charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is\nready with datanodes.\n\n## Smoke Test\nThis charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the\napplication is functioning as expected. Run the action as follows:\n\n    juju run-action namenode/0 smoke-test\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action do namenode/0 smoke-test`.\n\nWatch the progress of the smoke test actions with:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.\n\nEventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it\nreports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get\nmore information about a specific smoke test with:\n\n    juju show-action-output <action-id>\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.\n\n## Utilities\nThis charm includes Hadoop command line and web utilities that can be used\nto verify information about the cluster.\n\nShow the dfsadmin report on the command line with the following:\n\n    juju run --application namenode \"su hdfs -c 'hdfs dfsadmin -report'\"\n\nTo access the HDFS web console, find the `PUBLIC-ADDRESS` of the\nnamenode application and expose it:\n\n    juju status namenode\n    juju expose namenode\n\nThe web interface will be available at the following URL:\n\n        http://NAMENODE_PUBLIC_IP:50070\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\n- <bigdata@lists.ubuntu.com>\n\n\n# Resources\n\n- [Apache Bigtop](http://bigtop.apache.org/) home page\n- [Apache Bigtop issue tracking](http://bigtop.apache.org/issue-tracking.html)\n- [Apache Bigtop mailing lists](http://bigtop.apache.org/mail-lists.html)\n- [Juju Bigtop charms](https://jujucharms.com/q/apache/bigtop)\n- [Juju mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/juju)\n- [Juju community](https://jujucharms.com/community)\n",
