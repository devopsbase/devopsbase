  "description": "Combined slave node (DataNode + NodeManager) from Apache Bigtop.\n\nHadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and run applications that process vast amounts of data.\nThis charm provides both the storage node (DataNode) for HDFS and the compute node (NodeManager) for Yarn.\n",

If Juju is not yet set\nup, please follow the [getting-started][] instructions prior to deploying this\ncharm.\n\nThis charm is intended to be deployed via one of the [apache bigtop bundles][].\nFor example:\n\n    juju deploy hadoop-processing\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, use [juju-quickstart][] with the following syntax: `juju quickstart\nhadoop-processing`.\n\nThis will deploy an Apache Bigtop cluster with 3 units of this charm acting as\nthe combined DataNode/NodeManager application. More information about this\ndeployment can be found in the [bundle readme](https://jujucharms.com/hadoop-processing/).\n\n## Network-Restricted Environments\nCharms can be deployed in environments with limited network access. To deploy\nin this environment, configure a Juju model with appropriate proxy and/or\nmirror options. See [Configuring Models][] for more information.\n\n[getting-started]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/getting-started\n[apache bigtop bundles]: https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-charmers/#bundles\n[juju-quickstart]: https://launchpad.net/juju-quickstart\n[Configuring Models]: https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/models-config\n\n\n# Verifying\n\n## Status\nApache Bigtop charms provide extended status reporting to indicate when they\nare ready:\n\n    juju status\n\nThis is particularly useful when combined with `watch` to track the on-going\nprogress of the deployment:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju status\n\nThe message column will provide information about a given unit's state.\nThis charm is ready for use once the status message indicates that it is\nready as a datanode/nodemanager.\n\n## Smoke Test\nThis charm provides a `smoke-test` action that can be used to verify the\napplication is functioning as expected. This action executes the 'hdfs'\nand 'mapreduce' smoke tests provided by Apache Bigtop and may take up to\n30 minutes to complete. Run the action as follows:\n\n    juju run-action slave/0 smoke-test\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action do slave/0 smoke-test`.\n\nWatch the progress of the smoke test actions with:\n\n    watch -n 2 juju show-action-status\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action status`.\n\nEventually, the action should settle to `status: completed`.  If it\nreports `status: failed`, the application is not working as expected. Get\nmore information about a specific smoke test with:\n\n    juju show-action-output <action-id>\n\n> **Note**: The above assumes Juju 2.0 or greater. If using an earlier version\nof Juju, the syntax is `juju action fetch <action-id>`.\n\n\n# Scaling\n\nTo scale the cluster compute and storage capabilities, simply add more\nslave units. To add one unit:\n\n    juju add-unit slave\n\nMultiple units may be added at once.  For example, add four more slave units:\n\n    juju add-unit -n4 slave\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\n- <bigdata@lists.ubuntu.com>\n\n\n# Resources\n\n- [Apache Bigtop](http://bigtop.apache.org/) home page\n- [Apache Bigtop issue tracking](http://bigtop.apache.org/issue-tracking.html)\n- [Apache Bigtop mailing lists](http://bigtop.apache.org/mail-lists.html)\n- [Juju Bigtop charms](https://jujucharms.com/q/apache/bigtop)\n- [Juju mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/juju)\n- [Juju community](https://jujucharms.com/community)\n",
