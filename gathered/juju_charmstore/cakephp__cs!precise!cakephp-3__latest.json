  "description": "CakePHP: the rapid development php framework\n\nThe CakePHP framework provides a robust base for your application. It can \nhandle every aspect, from the user's initial request all the way to the final\nrendering of a web page. And since the framework follows the principles of \nMVC, it allows you to easily customize and extend most aspects of your \napplication.\n\nThe framework also provides a basic organizational structure, from filenames \nto database table names, keeping your entire application consistent and \nlogical. This concept is simple but powerful. Follow the conventions and \nyou'll always know exactly where things are and how they're organized.\n",

Once bootstrapped, you should issue this commands:\n\n    juju deploy mysql\n\n    juju deploy cakephp\n\n    juju add-relation mysql cakephp\n\n    juju expose cakephp\n\n\nAfter successfully deployed, you can get the cakephp unit ip address with:\n\n    juju status\n\nand then browse to http://ip-address to access the service. The source files\nare installed at /var/www/cakephp in the unit machine's file system, you can\ncreate your own application right there.
