  "description": "Bans IP addresses that have too many authentication failures.\n\nFail2ban monitors log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,\n/var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily or persistently bans\nfailure-prone addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Fail2ban\nallows easy specification of different actions to be taken such as to\nban an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a\nnotification email.  By default, it comes with filter expressions for\nvarious services (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but\nconfiguration can be easily extended for monitoring any other text\nfile.  All filters and actions are given in the config files, thus\nfail2ban can be adopted to be used with a variety of files and\nfirewalls.\n",
