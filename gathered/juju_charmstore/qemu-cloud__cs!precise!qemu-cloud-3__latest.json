  "description": "A QEMU model running Ubuntu on the cloud\n\nThis will start a QEMU instance running Ubuntu. Currently this charm uses the\nARM/highbank model running Ubuntu 12.04 armhf, but could be expanded for\nother models in the future. A host port will be forwarded to the ssh port of\nthe QEMU instance. Note: this service models a 4G system, so a memory\nconstraint of >= 5G is recommended (deploy --constraints mem=5G).\n",
