  "description": "VoIP chat for online gaming (server)\n\nTeamSpeak is a quality, scalable application which enables people to\nspeak with one another over the Internet. TeamSpeak consists of both\nclient and server software. The server acts as a host to multiple\nclient connections, capable of handling literally thousands of\nsimultaneous users. This results in an Internet based teleconferencing\nsolution that works in a variety of applications such as team mates\nspeaking with one another while playing their favorite online game,\nsmall businesses cutting costs on long distance charges, or for\npersonal communication with friends and family.  This package contains\nthe server daemon.\n",
