To accomplish this Ghost supports using a\nthird party email service which it can communicate with to send these emails.\nGhost, and this charm, supports sending emails using Mailgun, Amazon SES, and\nGmail. Additional information about why Ghost needs this service and it's\nsupported platforms see [Mail configuration](http://support.ghost.org/mail/).\n\nTo specify a supported email service to use you simply need to set the\nconfiguration values in the charm and they will be generated for your Ghost\ninstance.\n\n#### Mailgun & Gmail\n\n    $ juju set ghost mailserver_username=<your username>\n    $ juju set ghost mailserver_password=<your password>\n    Then\n    $ juju set ghost mail_service=Mailgun\n    -or-\n    $ juju set ghost mail_service=Gmail\n\n#### Amazon SES\n\n    $ juju set ghost mailserver_username=<your username>\n    $ juju set ghost mailserver_password=<your password>\n    $ juju set ghost amazon_ses_host=<your ses host>\n    Then\n    $ juju set ghost mail_service=SES\n\nAfter this has been completed your Ghost server will restart and Ghost will\nnow be able to send emails using that provider. It's recommended to test this\nbefore you need it by creating a new user and pointing it to an email you\ncontrol and ensure that you get the validation email.\n\n\n# Connecting To MySQL\n\nBy default this charm uses Ghost's built in SQLite storage. If you would like to\nhorizontally scale your ghost instance you will need to use an external database\nlike MySQL.\n\n**If you already have blog posts in the SQLite database they will not be\ndeleted, but you will have to manually port them over to the MySQL database.**\n\nFirst you will need to deploy MySQL into your Juju environment:\n\n    $ juju deploy mysql\n\nAdditional details about the MySQL charm and configuration can be found in the\n[MySQL charm details](https://jujucharms.com/mysql/precise/) page.\n\nYou'll then need to relate the Ghost blog service to the MySQL service.\n\n    $ juju add-relation ghost mysql\n\nThe charm will then handle setting up all configuration options necessary to use\nthe MySQL database instead of the internal SQLite database.\n\n# Load Balancing\n\n    $ juju deploy haproxy\n    $ juju expose haproxy\n    $ juju unexpose ghost\n    $ juju add-relation ghost haproxy\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Original charm\n\nThis charm is ported over from the original excellent charm @\n[ghost-charm repository](https://github.com/hatched/ghost-charm)\n\n## Current charm updated for Trusty and using charms.reactive\n\n[juju-layer-ghost](https://github.com/battlemidget/juju-layer-ghost)\n\n\n# Bug Reports\n\nPlease file bugs for the Ghost blogging engine in the\n[TryGhost Ghost repository](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) and not in the\nghost-charm repository.\n\nIf you have found a bug with the ghost-charm itself they can be filed in the\n[juju-layer-ghost repository](https://github.com/battlemidget/juju-layer-ghost).\nPlease include exact steps to reproduce the issue and be as detailed as\npossible, including what version of Ubuntu you're running on, the version of\nthis charm you have deployed, the cloud your environment is running on, any\nother charms deployed to the environment.\n",
