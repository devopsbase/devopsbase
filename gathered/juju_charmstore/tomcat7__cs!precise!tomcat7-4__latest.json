The\n[tomcat](http://manage.jujucharms.com/precise/tomcat) charm contains all\nfeatures of the tomcat7 charm with additional functionality and additional\nconfiguration options. We recommend switching to this new charm, this charm is\nin the charm store for historical reasons. \n\n# Usage\n\nA simple deployment consists of a Tomcat service:\n\n    juju deploy tomcat7\n\nThat deploys Apache Tomcat version 7 on an Ubuntu image.\n\nTo expose Tomcat to the Internet:\n\n    juju expose tomcat7\n\nYou can then browse to http://tomat7-ip-address:8080 to see the default Tomcat\npage.\n\nThe Apache Tomcat software contains a Web Application Manager that allows\nremote deployment of web applications.  This process requires authentication\nand this charm defaults to username='admin' password='admin'\n\n# Configuration\n\nThis charm allows the configuration of the admin username and admin password.\nThe manager webapp is password protected \n\n    juju set tomcat7 admin_username=<username> juju set tomcat7\nadmin_password=<password>\n\n## Testing\n\nGo to http://tomcat7-ip-address:8080/manager to access the Tomcat Web\nApplication Manager. Authenticate with the admin username and password that\nwas set in the tomcat7 configuration.\n\nGot to http://tomcat7-ip-address:8080/host-manager for the Tomcat Virtual Host\nManager. Authenticate with the admin username and password set in the\nconfiguration.\n\n## Scale out Usage\n\nYou can deploy the tomcat7 charm in a cluster by using multicast.  By default,\nstatic membership is used over multicast based membership which means units\ndepend on local cluster configuration to determine cluster groups.  Multicast\nuses multicast UDP packets on a pre-determined address/port to determine\ncluster groups.  Where a cloud provider such as EC2 disables multicast traffic\nbetween instances, static membership must be used.  Where multicast traffic is\nallowed, it is preferred and may be enabled as follows:\n\n    # enable multicast clustering\n    juju set tomcat7 multicast=True\n\n    # set multicast address\n    juju set tomcat7 multicast_address=228.0.0.4\n\n    # set multicast port\n    juju set tomcat7 multicast_port=34569\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\nThis charm was originally created by Juan Negron <juan.negron@canonical.com>.\n\n# Apache Tomcat Project Information\n\n- [Apache Tomcat home page](http://tomcat.apache.org)\n- [Apache Tomcat Mailing Lists](http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html)\n- [Tomcat Wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FrontPage)\n- [Tomcat 7.0\n  Documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/index.html)\n- [Reporting Apache Tomcat Bugs](http://tomcat.apache.org/bugreport.html)\n",
