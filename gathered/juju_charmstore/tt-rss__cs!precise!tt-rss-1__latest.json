Taken from the main project site:\n\nTiny Tiny RSS is an open source web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator, designed to allow you to read news from any location, while feeling as close to a real desktop application as possible.\n\n# Usage\n\nTo deploy the charm, you will need a bootstrapped Juju environment with capacity for two additional machines. You could, however, use the deploy-to feature of jitsu to deploy these charms to a single machine.\n\nFirst deploy mysql then deploy tt-rss in your bootstrapped environment:\n\n    juju deploy mysql\n    juju deploy tt-rss\n\nNext configure tt-rss to use the mysql backend by adding a relation between the two:\n\n    juju add-relation tt-rss mysql\n\nFinally, expose the tt-rss service:\n\n    juju expose tt-rss\n\nYou can then browse to http://ip-address/tt-rss to configure the service. The default username and password are \"admin/password\". \n\n# Configuration\n\nCurrently, there are three configuration variables avialable to be set via Juju: fqdn, update-tasks, and update-interval.\n\n## FQDN\n\nThis setting will update the TT-RSS config.php variable 'SELF_URL_PATH'. To update it simply issue the following:\n\n    juju set tt-rss fqdn=mysite.example.com\n\nBelow is the yaml configuration found in the charm:\n\n    fqdn:\n      type: string\n      default: localhost\n      description: FQDN of the server\n\n## Update Tasks\n\nUpdate tasks are the number of spawned tasks used when calling the feed update function. For a installation with a high number of feeds, you may consider increasing the number of update tasks from the default value of '2'.\n\n    juju set tt-rss update-tasks=4\n\nBelow is the yaml configuration found in the charm:\n\n    update-tasks:\n      type: int\n      default: 2\n      description: number of feed update tasks to spawn\n\n## Update Interval\n\nThis configuration setting is used to set the frequency at which feeds are updated (in seconds). The current default setting is to update the installation feeds every 5 minutes. You can configure this by issuing the following:\n\n    juju set tt-rss update-interval=600\n\nBelow is the yaml configuration found in the charm:\n\n    update-interval:\n      type: int\n      default: 300\n      description: frequency to check for feed updates\n\n# Updating\n\nTo update your TT-RSS installation, it is recommended to use the updater plugin included in TT-RSS. This allows you to view and update your installation via the web interface. A helpful guide can be found on the TT-RSS site (http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki/InstallationNotes#In-place-upgrading).\n\n# Author and Charm Details\n\nAuthor: NextRevision (notarobot@nextrevision.net)\nReport bugs at: http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/tt-rss\nLocation: http://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/tt-rss\n\n",
