It is a \ncommon platform upon which medical informatics efforts in developing \ncountries can be built. The system is based on a conceptual database \nstructure which is not dependent on the actual types of medical information \nrequired to be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can \nbe customized for different uses.\n",

It is a common platform upon which medical \ninformatics efforts in developing countries can be built.  The system is \nbased on a conceptual database structure which is not dependent on the \nactual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular \ndata collection forms and so can be customized for different uses.  \n\n#Usage\n\n##General\n\nThe OpenMRS charm requires a database (MySQL) and an Application server \n(Apache Tomcat) to function properly.  The mysql and tomcat7 charms already \nhave the installation and configuration done for you.  \n\nUse the following steps to set up OpenMRS:\n\n        juju deploy mysql\n        juju deploy tomcat7\n        juju deploy openmrs\n        juju add-relation openmrs mysql  *(This step creates the openmrs database)* \n        juju add-relation openmrs tomcat7 *(This step installs OpenMRS in Tomcat)*\n        juju expose tomcat7\n\nOpenMRS requires a database connection and will remain undeployed until the \nrelation to MySQL exists.  If it the relation is removed or destroyed Tomcat \nwill be shutdown, OpenMRS will be undeployed and the charm will wait for a new \ndatbase connection.  \n\nIt is important to wait for OpenMRS and Tomcat to finish starting before \naccessing the web site.  Use the `juju status` command to see the status of \nthe deployments and to copy the IP address and http port of Tomcat.  \n\n##OpenMRS one time setup\n\nJuju has created the virtual servers, installed the software, created the \ndatabase, deployed the web application and connected these services for you. \nOpenMRS must be configured manually the first time it is used.  Refer to the \n[OpenMRS documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Step+6+-+Configure+OpenMRS) \nfor details of the setup.\n\nTo setup OpenMRS browse to: **http://tomcat-host:port/openmrs**  \nReplace \"tomcat-host\" with the public IP address from 'juju status' command.  \nReplace \"port\" with the http_port of the Tomcat charm.  \n\nThe OpenMRS Installation Wizard is available in different languages, select \nthe desired language.  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to continue.  \n\n**Which type of installation do you want?**  Select **Advanced** because \nthis option allows connecting to an existing database. Juju has already created \nthe \"openmrs\" database, and any further attempts to create the database will \nresult in an error.  \n\n**Step 1** - Juju has already created and configured the MySQL database for \nOpenMRS, and should have `Database connection` filled in with the IP address of \nMySQL. `Database Driver` is optional, leave this option blank. \nSelect **Yes** to the question: \"Do you currently have an OpenMRS database \ninstalled that you would like to connect to?\"  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to continue.  \n\n**Step 2** - Select **Yes** for OpenMRS to **create the tables** in the \ndatabase and decide if you want the demo data added. The database `Username` \nand `Password` should already be filled in by Juju (you are welcome)!  \n\nRead the options on the next step and make the appropriate selections for \nupload modules and automatic deploy of database (the defaults are fine).  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to continue.  \n\nCreate the OpenMRS administrator's password.  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to continue.  \n\nThe Implementation details are optional.  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to continue.  \n\nReview the operations and make sure that the wizard is not going to create \nanother database (if so, go back to step 1 and select **connect to** an \nexisting database).  \nSelect the green arrow (->) to **finish**.  \n\nYou will be brought to the OpenMRS login screen. Use admin and the OpenMRS \nadministrator's password that you set up earlier and start using OpenMRS!  \n\n##Contact Information\n\nMore information about OpenMRS can be found at:  \n    - [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/)  \n    - [OpenMRS FAQ](http://openmrs.org/about/faq/)  \n    - [OpenMRS Module Repository](https://modules.openmrs.org/modules/)  \n    - [Documentation OpenMRS Wiki](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Home)  \n\n",
