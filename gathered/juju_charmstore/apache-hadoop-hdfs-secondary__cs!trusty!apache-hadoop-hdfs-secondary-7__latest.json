  "license": "## Overview\n\nThe Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the\ndistributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers\nusing a simple programming model.\n\nThis charm deploys a node running the SecondaryNameNode component\n[Apache Hadoop 2.4.1](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/), which\nperiodically consolidates and checkpoints the work done by the\nNameNode component for efficiency and improved recovery in the case\nof a failure of the NameNode.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis charm is intended to be deployed via one of the\n[apache bundles](https://jujucharms.com/u/bigdata-charmers/#bundles).\nFor example:\n\n    juju quickstart apache-analytics-sql\n\nThis will deploy the Apache Hadoop platform with Apache Hive available to\nperform SQL-like queries against your data.\n\nYou can also manually load and run map-reduce jobs via the plugin charm\nincluded in the bigdata bundles linked above:\n\n    juju scp my-job.jar plugin/0:\n    juju ssh plugin/0\n    hadoop jar my-job.jar\n\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThis charm supports monitoring via Ganglia.  To enable monitoring, you must\ndo **both** of the following (the order does not matter):\n\n * Add a relation to the [Ganglia charm][] via the `:master` relation\n * Enable the `ganglia_metrics` config option\n\nYou must **also** enable metrics on [hdfs-master][] to initiate the restart\nof the SecondaryNameNode component for it to begin collecting metrics.\n\nFor example:\n\n    juju add-relation secondary-namenode ganglia:master\n    juju add-relation hdfs-master ganglia:master\n    juju set secondary-namenode ganglia_metrics=true\n    juju set hdfs-master ganglia_metrics=true\n\n\n## Deploying in Network-Restricted Environments\n\nThe Apache Hadoop charms can be deployed in environments with limited network\naccess. To deploy in this environment, you will need a local mirror to serve\nthe packages and resources required by these charms.\n\n\n### Mirroring Packages\n\nYou can setup a local mirror for apt packages using squid-deb-proxy.\nFor instructions on configuring juju to use this, see the\n[Juju Proxy Documentation](https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/howto-proxies.html).\n\n\n### Mirroring Resources\n\nIn addition to apt packages, the Apache Hadoop charms require a few binary\nresources, which are normally hosted on Launchpad. If access to Launchpad\nis not available, the `jujuresources` library makes it easy to create a mirror\nof these resources:\n\n    sudo pip install jujuresources\n    juju-resources fetch --all /path/to/resources.yaml -d /tmp/resources\n    juju-resources serve -d /tmp/resources\n\nThis will fetch all of the resources needed by this charm and serve them via a\nsimple HTTP server. The output from `juju-resources serve` will give you a\nURL that you can set as the `resources_mirror` config option for this charm.\nSetting this option will cause all resources required by this charm to be\ndownloaded from the configured URL.\n\nYou can fetch the resources for all of the Apache Hadoop charms\n(`apache-hadoop-hdfs-master`, `apache-hadoop-yarn-master`,\n`apache-hadoop-hdfs-secondary`, `apache-hadoop-plugin`, etc) into a single\ndirectory and serve them all with a single `juju-resources serve` instance.\n\n\n## Contact Information\n\n- <bigdata@lists.ubuntu.com>\n\n\n## Hadoop\n\n- [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) home page\n- [Apache Hadoop bug trackers](http://hadoop.apache.org/issue_tracking.html)\n- [Apache Hadoop mailing lists](http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html)\n- [Apache Hadoop Juju Charm](http://jujucharms.com/?text=hadoop)\n",
