Learn more\nat [pig.apache.org](http://pig.apache.org).\n\nThis charm supports running Pig in two execution modes:\n\n * Local Mode: Pig runs using your local host and file system. Specify local\n   mode using the -x flag: `pig -x local`\n * Mapreduce Mode: Pig runs using a Hadoop cluster and HDFS. This is the default\n   mode; you can, optionally, specify it using the -x flag:\n   `pig` or `pig -x mapreduce`\n\n## Usage\nThis charm leverages our pluggable Hadoop model with the `hadoop-plugin`\ninterface. This means that you will need to deploy a base Apache Hadoop cluster\nto run Pig. The suggested deployment method is to use the\n[apache-analytics-pig](https://jujucharms.com/apache-analytics-pig/)\nbundle. This will deploy the Apache Hadoop platform with a single Apache Pig\nunit that communicates with the cluster by relating to the\n`apache-hadoop-plugin` subordinate charm:\n\n    juju quickstart apache-analytics-pig\n\nAlternatively, you may manually deploy the recommended environment as follows:\n\n    juju deploy apache-hadoop-hdfs-master hdfs-master\n    juju deploy apache-hadoop-yarn-master yarn-master\n    juju deploy apache-hadoop-compute-slave compute-slave\n    juju deploy apache-hadoop-plugin plugin\n    juju deploy apache-pig pig\n\n    juju add-relation yarn-master hdfs-master\n    juju add-relation compute-slave yarn-master\n    juju add-relation compute-slave hdfs-master\n    juju add-relation plugin yarn-master\n    juju add-relation plugin hdfs-master\n    juju add-relation pig plugin\n\n### Local Mode\nOnce deployment is complete, run Pig in local mode on the Pig unit with the\nfollowing:\n\n    juju ssh pig/0\n    pig -x local\n\n### MapReduce Mode\nMapReduce mode is the default for Pig.
