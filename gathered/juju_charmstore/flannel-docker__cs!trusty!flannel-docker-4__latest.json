The subnet allocation is done with the help of etcd which maintains\nthe overlay subnet to host mappings.\n\nThis charm uses flannel to setup an overlay network and configures docker containers\non that host to use the overlay.\n\n> **NOTE!** For up to date, and complete documentation - please see the [Charm Documentation](http://chuckbutler.github.io/flannel-docker-charm/) Site.\n\n## Charm Usage\n\nFlannel-docker is a subordinate charm, and is designed to be be deployed into the scope of\na docker host, configuring its networking bridge (docker0) to use the TUN/TAP overlay\nnetwork so docker containers can communicate cross-host. This facilitates in HA and colocated\nnetworking deployment.\n\n#### Deployment\n\nStart by deploying ETCD to your bootstrap node (this is for cost reduction, its not uncommon for multiple etcd hosts to reside as a cluster for HA scenarios. This particular deployment is non-HA)\n\nDeploy the docker charm, and flannel-docker. Then relate docker to flannel-docker, and flannel-docker to etcd. The networking magic will reconfigure the network as a mesh overlay.\n\n    juju deploy cs:~kubernetes/trusty/etcd --to 0\n    juju deploy trusty/docker\n    juju deploy trusty/flannel-docker\n    juju add-relation flannel-docker:docker-host docker:juju-info\n    juju add-relation flannel-docker:db etcd:client\n    juju add-relation flannel-docker:network docker:network\n\n## Known Limitations\n\nThis charm does not currently work with the Juju local provider. The combination\nof apparmor and LXC prevent the flannel function from working.  Deploy this\ncharm to a cloud environment.\n\nThe included binary files are amd64 only.
