The focus of Jenkins is the \nbuilding/testing of software project continuously, \nand monitoring executions of externally-run jobs.\nMore information at http://jenkins-ci.org/.\n\nThis charm provides the Jenkins master service,\nand when paired with the jenkins-slave charm \nprovides an easy way to deploy Jenkins on Ubuntu\nserver, and scale out Jenkins slaves.\n",
