In order\nfor it to work properly, it needs a MySQL instance related to it.\n\n# Usage\n\nFirst, bootstrap your environment:\n\n    juju bootstrap\n\nThen, deploy the service and the MySQL, and add the relations:\n\n    juju deploy chamilo\n    juju deploy mysql\n    juju add-relation chamilo mysql\n\nNext, set the domain that you want to use Chamilo with, as well as the admin\nusername and password:\n\n    juju set chamilo domain=[domain] user=[username] pass=[password]\n\nFinally, expose the service:\n\n    juju expose chamilo\n\nYou can then browse to http://doma.in to access the service.\n\nOnce you log in, you can change the default username information from the\n\"Administration\" panel.\n\n## Known Limitations and Issues\n\nAs Chamilo stores files in the local web server, is it not currenly possible to\nscale out Chamilo.\n\nAlso, the version is currently hardcoded to 1.9.8.\n\nFinally, please note that if a database was related but then the relation is\ndestroyed, and the database re-added, all data will be lost. Be careful with\nthis in production environments.\n\n# Configuration\n\nThis charm has only a few configuration options:\n\n`domain`: The domain name to be used with Chamilo. It is a required value,\notherwise the assets won't load.\n\n`user`: The first administrator username. If not set, it will default to\n\"admin\".\n\n`pass`: The default password for the administrator username. It is a required\nvalue, otherwise the charm will not finish deploying.\n\n# Internet Connectivity Requirements\n\nIn order for this charm to deploy correctly, it needs to connect to the\nfollowing internet sites:\n\n * campus.chamilo.org with port 443\n * The Ubuntu repositories or a mirror of them\n\n# Contact Information\n\nAuthor: José Antonio Rey <jose@ubuntu.com>  \nReport bugs at: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/chamilo>  \nLocation: <http://jujucharms.com>\n\n## Chamilo\n\n- [Chamilo website](http://chamilo.org)\n- [Chamilo bug tracker](https://support.chamilo.org/projects/chamilo-18/issues)\n",
