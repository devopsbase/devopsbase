  "description": "Openstack measures collection system\n\nCeilometer project aims to become the infrastructure to collect measurements\nwithin OpenStack so that no two agents would need to be written to collect\nthe same data. It's primary targets are monitoring and metering, but the\nframework should be easily expandable to collect for other needs. To that\neffect, Ceilometer should be able to share collected data with a variety\nof consumers.\n",
