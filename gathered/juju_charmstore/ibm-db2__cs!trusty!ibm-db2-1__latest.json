It delivers high performance across multiple workloads, while helping to reduce administration, storage, development and server costs.\nDB2 Server is provided as part of this charm.\n\nFor details on DB2, as well as information on purchasing, please visit:\n[Product Page LUW][product-page-enterprise] and [Product Page Express][product-page-express]\n\nMore information available at the [IBM Knowledge Center][ibm-db2]\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe user will need to procure the appropriate license to be able to download and use IBM DB2. \n\nTo acquire and download DB2, follow instructions available at [Product Page LUW][product-page-enterprise] or [Product Page Express][product-page-express].\nThe tab `Support&downloads` in [Product Page LUW][product-page-enterprise] gives different options for downloading the packages. \n\nDownload steps for IBM DB2 10.5 using [Passport Advantage][passport-advantage] is mentioned in [Downloading IBM DB2 10.5 for LUW][download-db2]. The Part Number used is CIXV0ML for X86-64 platform and that for Power is CN3YQML. To get more information on accessing [Passport Advantage][passport-advantage] please visit the link [Accessing Passport Advantage][access-passport-advantage].\n\nTo install the downloaded binaries you must agree to the IBM license. You can view the full license for DB2 by visiting the [Software license agreements search website][license-info]. Search for \"DB2 Enterprise Server Edition 10.5.0.5\" and choose the license that applies to the version you are using.\n\nIn case you already have an IBM account and cannot download the product or for other error during SW download, please refer to the [IBM Support Site][ibm-support] to solve the error.\n\nDownload of Product Binaries\n----------------------------\nFor deploying IBM DB2 charm the user needs to download the correct package as mentioned in the `Usage` section into an SFTP server. The  IBM DB2 charm will connect to the SFTP server, download and deploy the same. The SFTP server can be any Power Ubuntu/X86 Ubuntu server and should be copied into a directory structure as below\n`/home/charm/repository/<productname>/<package.tar>`. The complete path where the package is stored is a configurable item in config.yaml file and needs to be configured before deploying the charm. The charm will download the package from this server using SFTP. Hence make sure the SFTP link is accessible. \n\nMemory and Disk Requirements\n----------------------------\nAt a minimum, a DB2 database system requires 256 MB of RAM. For a system running just a DB2 product and the DB2 GUI tools, a minimum of 512 MB of RAM is required. However, 1 GB of RAM is recommended for improved performance.\n\nOn Linux and UNIX operating systems, 2 GB of free space in the /tmp directory is recommended. Please make sure this minimum memory configuration is available before deploying the charm. More information on this can be found in [Memory Requirements][db2-memory-disk-requirement]\n\nDeploy\n------\nTo deploy DB2 charm run the following command:\n\n1. Make sure the appropriate memory requirements are made available\n\n2. For deploying either use an existing machine, or create a new machine using\n\n        juju add-machine\n        juju deploy --to <machine number> --repository=<path_to_charms_folder> local:trusty/ibm-db2\n\n3. Set all required config values like the SFTP server,  package name, directory in SFTP server where package is kept, username and password to connect to SFTP host and checksum value to proceed with installation, by using juju set command. To provide these run the following command: \n\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 host=<host-name>\n        juju set ibm-db2 package_dir=<full-path-to-the-directory>\n        juju set ibm-db2 username=<user-name>\n        juju set ibm-db2 password=<passwd>\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_package_name=<package-name>\n        juju set ibm-db2 sha= <checksum-value>\n\n  For eg:\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 host=\"x.x.x.x\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 package_dir=\"/home/charm/repository/ibm-db2\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 username=\"user1\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 password=\"password\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_package_name=\"DB2_Svr_10.5.0.3_Linux_x86-64.tar.gz\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 sha=80501df818faf4f095b5a58210a0e110509fcb70\n\n   \n   The command to find the checksum value is `sha1sum <Package Name> | cut -d\" \" -f1`\n\n4. At this point DB2 install will wait for you to accept the License. To install the downloaded binaries you must agree to the IBM license.  The license file(s) can be found in the product binaries you downloaded.\n\n    If you agree to the license, run the following command :\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 accept-ibm-db2-license=True\n\n    Juju deploy command will install db2 and will expose the hostname, portnumber, db2 instance, install path  and userid to the users. \n\n\nUninstallation of IBM DB2\n---------------------------\n\nSetting the accept-ibm-db2-license to False will uninstall the product. \n\n        juju set ibm-db2 accept-ibm-db2-license=False\n\nAdditional configuration parameters \n-----------------------------------\n\nFollowing shows the different configurable values for ibm-db2 charm:\n \n* If the user wants to set a different file path used to create databases and logs it can be set using the config value dftdbpath. Use the following command to set it\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 dftdbpath=<new-path-to-set>\n\n    For eg:\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 dftdbpath=\"/tmp\"\n\n* If you want to add a new user/password and instance name for DB2 you can do that by giving the following commands. \n\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_user=<newusername>\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_pw=<newuserpassword>\n\n    For eg:\n\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_user=\"user1\"\n        juju set ibm-db2 db2_pw=\"user123\"  \n\nIf the db2_user and db2_pw is not set, then be default the charm will create db2usr1/db2usr123 using which you can connect and work with DB2. A new instance name with same name as db2_user will also be generated. \n\nInstallation Verification\n------------------------\nOnce IBM DB2 charm is deployed, the user can log into the container/machine where its deployed and use the db2_user/db2_pw combination to login as the db2 user. The user can run any db2 commands after this. \n  \n  * For creating a new DB the user may run the command:\n\n        db2 create database <db-name>\n\n  * For listing the DBs created, run the command:\n        \n        db2 list db directory\n\n  * For getting db2 command prompt just run the command:\n\n        db2\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\nSee config.yaml file for more information.\n\n  *  `accept-ibm-db2-license`: True to accept license. Before you can use or install IBM DB2, you must accept the terms of International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs and additional license information. Please read the license agreement carefully. The license file(s) can be found under the server/db2/license directory after downloading and extracting IBM DB2 there. Set the value of accept-ibm-db2-license to True if you agree to IBM DB2 license.\n\n  * `sha`                   : Check sum value to check integrity of IBM DB2 package. The Charm uses sha1sum to check the integrity. If empty, it will fail to deploy DB2. Cryptographic value should be altered by the user only when the package name is changed. Else it should not be altered. The command to find the check sum is \n        \n        sha1sum <Package Name> | cut -d\" \" -f1\n\n     This value can be got from the administrator or the user can run the above command from the sftp server where the package resides. \n\n  * `dftdbpath`             : This parameter contains the default file path used to create databases under the database manager.  If no path is specified when a database is created, the database is created under the path specified by the dftdbpath parameter.\n\n  * `db2_user`              : The user name to connect to DB2 and work on the same. Db2 will create a new instance with the same name as this user name.\n  \n  * `db2_pw`                : The password for db2_user\n\n  * `host`                  : SFTP server where IBM DB2 packages is kept\n\n  * `package_dir`           : Path to find the IBM DB2 packages on the SFTP server\n\n  * `username`              : User name to connect to the SFTP server\n\n  * `password`              : Password to connect to the SFTP server\n\n  * `db2_package_name`      : Name of the DB2 package to be deployed\n\n\nAdditional product information\n------------------------------\n\n##### Enabling BLU acceleration for DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition/DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition\n\nThe same DB2 charm(DB2 Enterprise Server Edition) can be extended to enable the BLU acceleration(DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition/DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)  by following the below section. The DB2 charm has to be deployed first and then few settings needs to be done to enable the BLU feature. \n\nTo upgrade DB2 Enterprise Server Edition (DB2 ESE) to DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition(DB2 AESE) or DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (DB2 AWSE) the user need to accept the license for the same. Run the following command for accepting the AESE/AWSE license which the user procures on buying the Advanced Enterprise/ Workgroup Server Edition product. The user needs to log in using the configured user name/password to run the below commands.\n\n    db2licm -a </path/to/license/file/db2aese_u.lic>\n\tor\n    db2licm -a </path/to/license/file/db2awse_u.lic>\n    \n`db2licm -l` command will show the license details once you apply the license. \nNow to enable the BLU feature the DB2_WORKLOAD registry variable has to be set to ANALYTICS and then the DB has to be restarted. The following commands will help the user for this.\n\n    db2set DB2_WORKLOAD=ANALYTICS\n    db2stop force\n    db2start\n    \nTo test that DB2 AESE with BLU acceleration is enabled run the following command:\n    \n    db2 create database <test-db>\n    db2 connect to <test-db> \n    db2 get db cfg | grep DFT_TABLE_ORG\n    \nThe output Default table organization              (DFT_TABLE_ORG) = COLUMN confirms that the DB2 AESE/AWSE with BLU is enabled. If the pre requisites for DB2 for AESE/AWSE is not set (accepting the proper license and setting the registry variable DB2_WORKLOAD) the above command would return Default table organization              (DFT_TABLE_ORG) = ROW.  Column-organized tables store each column on a separate set of pages on disk. Organizing data by column on disk reduces the amount of I/O needed for processing queries because only columns that are referenced in a query need to be accessed. \n\nOnce this is set all the tables created will be by default COLUMN organized where as without BLU acceleration the tables will be ROW organized. Also without proper license we cannot create COLUMN organized tables. Once we enable COLUMN organized tables, we can create either ROW enabled or COLUMN enabled tables using the option ORGANIZE BY ROW or ORGANIZE BY COLUMN while creating the tables by running the below commands from db2 command prompt.\n\n    create table sales_row(tid integer not null, prod_name varchar(30)) ORGANIZE BY ROW\n    create table sales_col(tid integer not null, prod_name varchar(30)) ORGANIZE BY COLUMN\n\nThe following command will convert the ROW organized tables to COLUMN organized if the proper license is accepted. Without having valid license the following command will error out.  \n   \n    db2convert -d \t<test-db>\n    \nMore details on BLU feature can be found in the link [db2-BLU-acceleration]\n\nIBM DB2 Links and Contacts\n--------------------------\n\n(1) General Information\nInformation on IBM DB2 available at the [DB2 Knowledgecenter][db2-knowledgecenter]\n\n(2) Download Information\nInformation on procuring DB2 product is available at the [Passport Advantage Site][passport-db2]\n\n(3) Contact Information\nFor issues with this charm, please contact <jujusupp@us.ibm.com>\n\n\n<!-- Links -->\n\n[product-page-express]: http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/db2-express-server-edition\n\n[product-page-enterprise]: http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/linux-unix-windows/index.html\n\n[download-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21638030\n\n[passport-advantage]: http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage\n\n[access-passport-advantage]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21566554\n\n[ibm-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html\n\n[license-info]: http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/search\n\n[passport-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/\n\n[db2-knowledgecenter]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html\n\n[ibm-support]: https://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/myportal/support\n\n[db2-BLU-acceleration]: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1309db2bluaccel/\n\n[db2-memory-disk-requirement]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/r0008877.html?cp=SSEPGG_9.7.0%2F\n\n\n\n",

The user can run any db2 commands after this. \n  \n  * For creating a new DB the user may run the command:\n\n        db2 create database <db-name>\n\n  * For listing the DBs created, run the command:\n        \n        db2 list db directory\n\n  * For getting db2 command prompt just run the command:\n\n        db2\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\nSee config.yaml file for more information.\n\n  *  `accept-ibm-db2-license`: True to accept license. Before you can use or install IBM DB2, you must accept the terms of International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs and additional license information. Please read the license agreement carefully. The license file(s) can be found under the server/db2/license directory after downloading and extracting IBM DB2 there. Set the value of accept-ibm-db2-license to True if you agree to IBM DB2 license.\n\n  * `sha`                   : Check sum value to check integrity of IBM DB2 package. The Charm uses sha1sum to check the integrity. If empty, it will fail to deploy DB2. Cryptographic value should be altered by the user only when the package name is changed. Else it should not be altered. The command to find the check sum is \n        \n        sha1sum <Package Name> | cut -d\" \" -f1\n\n     This value can be got from the administrator or the user can run the above command from the sftp server where the package resides. \n\n  * `dftdbpath`             : This parameter contains the default file path used to create databases under the database manager.  If no path is specified when a database is created, the database is created under the path specified by the dftdbpath parameter.\n\n  * `db2_user`              : The user name to connect to DB2 and work on the same. Db2 will create a new instance with the same name as this user name.\n  \n  * `db2_pw`                : The password for db2_user\n\n  * `host`                  : SFTP server where IBM DB2 packages is kept\n\n  * `package_dir`           : Path to find the IBM DB2 packages on the SFTP server\n\n  * `username`              : User name to connect to the SFTP server\n\n  * `password`              : Password to connect to the SFTP server\n\n  * `db2_package_name`      : Name of the DB2 package to be deployed\n\n\nAdditional product information\n------------------------------\n\n##### Enabling BLU acceleration for DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition/DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition\n\nThe same DB2 charm(DB2 Enterprise Server Edition) can be extended to enable the BLU acceleration(DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition/DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)  by following the below section. The DB2 charm has to be deployed first and then few settings needs to be done to enable the BLU feature. \n\nTo upgrade DB2 Enterprise Server Edition (DB2 ESE) to DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition(DB2 AESE) or DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (DB2 AWSE) the user need to accept the license for the same. Run the following command for accepting the AESE/AWSE license which the user procures on buying the Advanced Enterprise/ Workgroup Server Edition product. The user needs to log in using the configured user name/password to run the below commands.\n\n    db2licm -a </path/to/license/file/db2aese_u.lic>\n\tor\n    db2licm -a </path/to/license/file/db2awse_u.lic>\n    \n`db2licm -l` command will show the license details once you apply the license. \nNow to enable the BLU feature the DB2_WORKLOAD registry variable has to be set to ANALYTICS and then the DB has to be restarted. The following commands will help the user for this.\n\n    db2set DB2_WORKLOAD=ANALYTICS\n    db2stop force\n    db2start\n    \nTo test that DB2 AESE with BLU acceleration is enabled run the following command:\n    \n    db2 create database <test-db>\n    db2 connect to <test-db> \n    db2 get db cfg | grep DFT_TABLE_ORG\n    \nThe output Default table organization              (DFT_TABLE_ORG) = COLUMN confirms that the DB2 AESE/AWSE with BLU is enabled. If the pre requisites for DB2 for AESE/AWSE is not set (accepting the proper license and setting the registry variable DB2_WORKLOAD) the above command would return Default table organization              (DFT_TABLE_ORG) = ROW.  Column-organized tables store each column on a separate set of pages on disk. Organizing data by column on disk reduces the amount of I/O needed for processing queries because only columns that are referenced in a query need to be accessed. \n\nOnce this is set all the tables created will be by default COLUMN organized where as without BLU acceleration the tables will be ROW organized. Also without proper license we cannot create COLUMN organized tables. Once we enable COLUMN organized tables, we can create either ROW enabled or COLUMN enabled tables using the option ORGANIZE BY ROW or ORGANIZE BY COLUMN while creating the tables by running the below commands from db2 command prompt.\n\n    create table sales_row(tid integer not null, prod_name varchar(30)) ORGANIZE BY ROW\n    create table sales_col(tid integer not null, prod_name varchar(30)) ORGANIZE BY COLUMN\n\nThe following command will convert the ROW organized tables to COLUMN organized if the proper license is accepted. Without having valid license the following command will error out.  \n   \n    db2convert -d \t<test-db>\n    \nMore details on BLU feature can be found in the link [db2-BLU-acceleration]\n\nIBM DB2 Links and Contacts\n--------------------------\n\n(1) General Information\nInformation on IBM DB2 available at the [DB2 Knowledgecenter][db2-knowledgecenter]\n\n(2) Download Information\nInformation on procuring DB2 product is available at the [Passport Advantage Site][passport-db2]\n\n(3) Contact Information\nFor issues with this charm, please contact <jujusupp@us.ibm.com>\n\n\n<!-- Links -->\n\n[product-page-express]: http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/db2-express-server-edition\n\n[product-page-enterprise]: http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/linux-unix-windows/index.html\n\n[download-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21638030\n\n[passport-advantage]: http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage\n\n[access-passport-advantage]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21566554\n\n[ibm-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html\n\n[license-info]: http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/search\n\n[passport-db2]: http://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/\n\n[db2-knowledgecenter]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html\n\n[ibm-support]: https://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/myportal/support\n\n[db2-BLU-acceleration]: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1309db2bluaccel/\n\n[db2-memory-disk-requirement]: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/r0008877.html?cp=SSEPGG_9.7.0%2F\n\n\n\n",
