  "description": "RESTful document oriented database, system DB\n\nApache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free\ndocument-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API.\nAmong other features, it provides robust, incremental replication with\nbi-directional conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and\nindexable using a table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as\nthe default view definition language.  CouchDB is written in Erlang,\nbut can be easily accessed from any environment that provides means to\nmake HTTP requests. There are a multitude of third-party client\nlibraries that make this even easier for a variety of programming\nlanguages and environments.\n",
