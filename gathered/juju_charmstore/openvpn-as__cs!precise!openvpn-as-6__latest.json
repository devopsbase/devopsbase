Below is a\ndescription taken from the main project site:\n\nOpenVPN Access Server is a full featured SSL VPN software solution that\nintegrates OpenVPN server capabilities, enterprise management capabilities,\nsimplified OpenVPN Connect UI, and OpenVPN Client software packages that\naccommodate Windows, MAC, and Linux OS environments. OpenVPN Access Server\nsupports a wide range of configurations, including secure and granular remote\naccess to internal network and/ or private cloud network resources and\napplications with fine-grained access control. \n\n# Usage\n\nTo deploy the charm, you will first need a bootstrapped Juju environment and,\nat a minimum, capacity for one additional machine.\n\nDeploy openvpn-as to a bootstrapped environment:\n\n    juju deploy openvpn-as\n\nIt is recommended that you change the default password for the instance:\n\n    juju set openvpn-as password=newpassword\n\nFinally, expose the service:\n\n    juju expose openvpn-as\n\nYou can then browse to https://ip-address-or-fqdn/admin to configure\nOpenVPN-AS. The username and password by default are 'openvpn/openvpn-as'. If\nyou set the password as recommended above, then use that password instead of\nthe default.\n\n# Connecting to the VPN\n\nThe easiest way to establish a connection to the VPN is to authenticate via\nthe login page at https://ip-address-or-fqdn. This will give access to client\npackages and config files needed for client connections.\n\n## Basic Linux Client Usage\n\nTo connect to the VPN using a Linux distribution, the openvpn package is\nrequired on the client. Then you may login to the OpenVPN-AS web client and\ndownload a configuration for your user. Run the OpenVPN client with the\ndownloaded configuration and you should see a connection established. Below\nare the common steps to install an use the OpenVPN client with the downloaded\nconfig file 'client.ovpn':\n\n    sudo apt-get install openvpn\n    sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn\n    \n## Basic Windows and Mac Usage\n\nTo connect to the VPN with a Windows or Mac OS, a client executable is\navailable from the web portal once successfully authenticated. Clients will be\nprompted to download the client and continue.\n\n## Advanced Linux Client Usage with NetworkManager\n\nTo import a VPN configuration into NetworkManager, the NetworkManager OpenVPN\npackage must be installed and the client keys and certficates as well as CA\ncertificate must be extracted from the OpenVPN-AS server. In order to do this,\nyou must know the machine number running the OpenVPN-AS service. For this\nexample, we will assume the machine number is \"1\" and the client is 'johndoe'.\n\n    juju ssh 1\n    mkdir /tmp/johndoe_client\n    sudo /usr/local/openvpn_as/scripts/sacli -a johndoe \\\n        -o /tmp/johndoe_client/ --cn johndoe get5\n    cd /tmp && tar -czf /home/ubuntu/johndoe-openvpn.tgz \\\n        johndoe_client/\n    rm -Rf johndoe_client\n    exit\n\nThis process uses the OpenVPN-AS script to get the user certificate, key,\nclient config file, CA certificate and TLS key then creates a tarball in the\ndefault user's home directory. Now copy the certificate to your computer for\nredistribution and delete the original file:\n\n    juju scp 1:~/johndoe-openvpn.tgz .\n    juju ssh 1 \"sudo rm johndoe_client.tgz && exit\"\n    \nFor instructions on how to import the downloaded files into NetworkManager,\nreference the following article: http://bit.ly/15dVReF\n\n# Configuration\n\nThere are a number of configuration options available via the charm. Most of\nthe options, however, can be modified using the OpenVPN-AS Admin UI, but are\nprovided in the charm as a means of convenience and rapid deployment.\n\nBy default, the username is 'openvpn' and PAM is used as the authentication\nbackend. These options can be changed via the OpenVPN-AS Admin UI and are left\nat their default settings in order to ensure a low barrier to deployment.\nOpenVPN defaults to this username, and this username can be disabled if desired.\n\n## FQDN\n\nThe FQDN of the service will default to the public address of the machine it is\ndeployed on. The FQDN is referenced in the client configuration downloaded by\nclients connecting to the VPN. The VPN will not be able to establish a successful\nconnection until the FQDN correctly resolves to the OpenVPN-AS service.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as fqdn=example.site.com\n\n## Password\n\nThis option sets the password on the service for the 'openvpn' admin user.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as password=newpassword\n\n## Port\n\nThe port configuration option determines the port used to manage, log in, and\nconnect to the service. When the port is changed, any prior downloaded\nconfigurations will need to be reconfigured for each client previously using\nthe service.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as port=8443\n\n## Client Network\n\nThe client network option configures the network used when assigning VPN\nclients addresses. If you're home or corporate network use the same range as\nthe default, then you may consider changing it to an alternate network range. A\nCIDR value is required or a '/24' CIDR will be assigned to the network given.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as client-network=10.11.12.0/23\n\n## Reroute Gateway\n\nBy default all client traffic will be routed through the VPN tunnel. To\ndisallow clients from sending all traffic through the VPN tunnel, set this\nvalue to 'False'. This will only allow clients to access remote subnets located\nbehind the subnet. A list of networks to be routed through the VPN can be\nconfigured through the Admin UI.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as reroute-gateway=False\n\n## Reroute DNS\n\nBy default all DNS queries will be routed through the VPN tunnel. To disable\nthis, set the following option to False.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as reroute-dns=False\n\n## License\n\nIn order to use more than the default 2 concurrent client sessions, a valid\nlicense will be needed from\nhttps://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/license-key.html. Once a license\nhas been acquired, you can install it via this option.\n\n    juju set openvpn-as license=XXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n# Contact Information\n\nAuthor: NextRevision <notarobot@nextrevision.net>\nReport bugs at: http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms/+source/openvpn-as\nLocation: http://jujucharms.com/charms/distro/openvpn-as\n",
