It offers a powerful web-based interface with broad browser\nsupport for managing review requests and reviewing code.\n\nThis charm will deploy Review Board and connect it to a running\nPostgreSQL database. This charm will deploy the Review Board files in\n`/var/www/reviewboard/`\n\n\n# Usage\n\nTo deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud environment,\nworking Juju installation an admin password and, finally, a successful\nbootstrap. Once bootstrapped, deploy the PostgreSQL charm and then\nthis Review Board charm, setting the admin password:\n\n    juju deploy postgresql\n    juju deploy reviewboard\n    juju set reviewboard admin-password=`YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD`\n\nAdd a relation between the two of them:\n\n    juju add-relation postgresql:db reviewboard\n\nAnd finally expose the Review Board service:\n\n    juju expose reviewboard\n\nYou can now login to your freshly minted Review Board by looking at\nthe public address of your reviewboard unit in `juju status`.  Log in\ntheir with username `admin` and the password you set above.\n\n## Known Limitations and Issues\n\n* Add support for MySQL as a database backend.\n * Switch package installation between `python-psycopg2` and `python-mysqldb`.\n * Change configuration of rb-site command.\n* Add configuration for setting up initial repositories?\n* Optionally allow relation to separate\n [memcached](https://jujucharms.com/sidebar/search/precise/memcached/)\n charm instead of using local memcached.\n\n# Configuration\n\nThe `admin-password` is a required configuration option, which sets\nthe password for the administrator user named `admin` which the charm\nwill automatically create.\n\nBy setting the `host` configuration option, you can change the base\nURL that Review Board thinks it's installed at.
