To deploy in this environment, you will need a local mirror to serve\nthe packages and resources required by these charms.\n\n\n### Mirroring Packages\n\nYou can setup a local mirror for apt packages using squid-deb-proxy.\nFor instructions on configuring juju to use this, see the\n[Juju Proxy Documentation](https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/howto-proxies.html).\n\n\n### Mirroring Resources\n\nIn addition to apt packages, the Apache Hadoop charms require a few binary\nresources, which are normally hosted on Launchpad. If access to Launchpad\nis not available, the `jujuresources` library makes it easy to create a mirror\nof these resources:\n\n    sudo pip install jujuresources\n    juju-resources fetch --all /path/to/resources.yaml -d /tmp/resources\n    juju-resources serve -d /tmp/resources\n\nThis will fetch all of the resources needed by this charm and serve them via a\nsimple HTTP server. The output from `juju-resources serve` will give you a\nURL that you can set as the `resources_mirror` config option for this charm.\nSetting this option will cause all resources required by this charm to be\ndownloaded from the configured URL.\n\nYou can fetch the resources for all of the Apache Hadoop charms\n(`apache-hadoop-hdfs-master`, `apache-hadoop-yarn-master`,\n`apache-hadoop-compute-slave`, `apache-hadoop-plugin`, etc) into a single\ndirectory and serve them all with a single `juju-resources serve` instance.\n\n\n## Contact Information\n\n- <bigdata@lists.ubuntu.com>\n\n\n## Hadoop\n\n- [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) home page\n- [Apache Hadoop bug trackers](http://hadoop.apache.org/issue_tracking.html)\n- [Apache Hadoop mailing lists](http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html)\n- [Apache Hadoop Juju Charm](http://jujucharms.com/?text=hadoop)\n",
