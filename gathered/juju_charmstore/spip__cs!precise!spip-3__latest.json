  "description": "website engine for publishing\n\nSPIP is a publishing system for the Internet in which great importance\nis attached to collaborative working, to multilingual environments,\nand to simplicity of use for web authors.  SPIP's benefit consists in:\n* managing a magazine type site i.e. made up mainly of   articles and\nnews items inserted in an arborescence   of sections nested in each\nothers. * completely separating and distributing three kinds of tasks\nover various players: the graphic design, the site editorial   input\nthrough the submission of articles and news items and   the site\neditorial management. * spare the webmaster and all the participants\nto the life of   the site, a number of tedious aspects of web\npublishing as   well as the need to learn lengthy technical skills.\nSPIP allows you to start creating your sections and   articles\nstraight away.\n",
