Linear scalability\nand proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure\nmake it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support\nfor replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower\nlatency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive\nregional outages.\n\nSee [cassandra.apache.org](http://cassandra.apache.org) for more information.\n\n\n# Editions\n\nThis charm supports Apache Cassandra 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 & 3.0, and\nDatastax Enterprise 4.7, 4.8 & 5.0. The default is Apache Cassandra 3.0.\n\nTo use a particular Apache Cassandra release, specify the relevant\ndeb archive in in the `install_sources` config setting when deploying.\n\n```yaml\n    install_sources:\n      - deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 22x main\n      - ppa:openjdk-r/ppa   # For OpenJDK 8\n      - ppa:stub/cassandra  # For Python driver\n```\n\nTo use Datastax Enterprise, set the `edition` config setting to `dse`\nand the Datastax Enterprise archive URL in `install_sources` (including your\nusername and password).\n\n```yaml\n    install_sources:\n      - deb http://un:pw@debian.datastax.com/enterprise stable main\n      - ppa:openjdk-r/ppa   # For OpenJDK 8\n      - ppa:stub/cassandra  # For Python driver\n```\n\n\n# Deployment\n\nCassandra deployments are relatively simple in that they consist of a set of\nCassandra nodes which seed from each other to create a ring of servers:\n    \n    juju deploy -n3 cs:trusty/cassandra\n\nThe service units will deploy and will form a single ring.\n\nNew nodes can be added to scale up:\n\n    juju add-unit cassandra\n\n\n/!\\ Nodes must be manually decommissioned before dropping a unit.\n\n    juju run --unit cassandra/1 \"nodetool decommission\"\n    # Wait until Mode is DECOMMISSIONED\n    juju run --unit cassandra/1 \"nodetool netstats\"\n    juju remove-unit cassandra/1\n\nIt is recommended to deploy at least 3 nodes and configure all your\nkeyspaces to have a replication factor of three. Using fewer nodes or\nneglecting to set your keyspaces' replication settings means that your\ndata is at risk and availability lower, as a failed unit may take the\nonly copy of data with it.\n\nProduction systems will normally want to set `max_heap_size` and\n`heap_newsize` to the empty string, to enable automatic memory size\ntuning. The defaults have been chosen to be suitable for development\nenvironments but will perform poorly with real workloads.\n\n\n## Planning\n\n- Do not attempt to store too much data per node. If you need more space,\n  add more nodes. Most workloads work best with a capacity under 1TB\n  per node.\n\n- You need to keep 50% of your disk space free for Cassandra maintenance\n  operations. If you expect your nodes to hold 500GB of data each, you\n  will need a 1TB partition. Using non-default compaction such as\n  LeveledCompactionStrategy can lower this waste.\n\n- Much more information can be found in the [Cassandra 2.2 documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/planning/planPlanningAbout.html)\n\n\n## Network Access\n\nThe default Cassandra packages are installed from the apache.org\narchive. To avoid this download, place a copy of the packages in a local\narchive and specify its location in the `install_sources` configuration\noption. The signing key is automatically added.\n\nWhen using DataStax Enterprise, you need to specify the archive location\ncontaining the DataStax Enterprise .deb packages in the\n`install_sources` configuration item, and the signing key in the\n`install_keys` configuration item. Place the DataStax packages in a\nlocal archive to avoid downloading from datastax.com.\n\n\n## Oracle Java SE\n\nCassandra recommends using Oracle Java SE 8. Unfortunately, this\nsoftware is accessible only after accepting Oracle's click-through\nlicense making deployments using it much more cumbersome. You will need\nto download the Oracle Java SE 8 Server Runtime for Linux, and place the\ntarball at a URL accessible to your deployed units. The config item\n`private_jre_url` needs to be set to this URL.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nTo relate the Cassandra charm to a service that understands how to talk to\nCassandra using Thrift or the native Cassandra protocol::\n\n    juju deploy cs:service-that-needs-cassandra\n    juju add-relation service-that-needs-cassandra cassandra:database\n\n\nAlternatively, if you require a superuser connection, use the\n`database-admin` relation instead of `database`::\n\n    juju deploy cs:admin-service\n    juju add-relation admin-service cassandra:database-admin\n\n\nClient charms need to provide nothing. The Cassandra service publishes the\nfollowing connection settings and cluster information on the client's relation:\n\n`username` and `password`:\n\n    Authentication credentials. The cluster is configured to use\n    the standard PasswordAuthenticator authentication provider, rather\n    than the insecure default. You can use different credentials\n    if you wish, using an account created through some other mechanism.\n\n`host`:\n\n    IP address to connect to.\n\n`native_transport_port`:\n\n    Port for drivers and tools using the newer native protocol.\n\n`rpc_port`:\n\n    Port for drivers and tools using the legacy Thrift protocol.\n\n`cluster_name`:\n\n    The cluster name. A client service may be related to several\n    Cassandra services, and this setting may be used to tell which\n    services belong to which cluster.\n\n`datacenter` and `rack`:\n\n    The datacenter and rack units in this service belong to. Required for\n    setting keyspace replication correctly.\n\nThe cluster is configured to use the recommended 'snitch'\n(GossipingPropertyFileSnitch), so you will need to configure replication of\nyour keyspaces using the NetworkTopologyStrategy replica placement strategy.\nFor example, using the default datacenter named 'juju':\n\n    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mydata WITH REPLICATION =\n    { 'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'juju': 3};\n\n\nAlthough authentication is configured using the standard\nPasswordAuthentication, by default no authorization is configured\nand the provided credentials will have access to all data on the cluster.\nFor more granular permissions, you will need to set the authorizer\nin the service configuration to CassandraAuthorizer and manually grant\npermissions to the users.\n\n\n# Known Limitations and Issues\n\nThis is the 'trusty' charm. Upgrade from the 'precise' charm is not supported.\n\nThe `system_auth` keyspace replication factor is automatically increased\nbut not decreased. If you have a service with three or more units and\ndecommission enough nodes to drop below three, you will need to manually\nupdate the `system_auth` keyspace replication settings.\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\n## Charm\n\n- [Cassandra Charm homepage](https://launchpad.net/cassandra-charm/)\n- [Source Code](https://code.launchpad.net/~cassandra-charmers/cassandra-charm/+git/cassandra-charm)\n- [Bug Reports](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cassandra-charm/)\n\n## Cassandra\n\n- [Apache Cassandra homepage](http://cassandra.apache.org/)\n- [Cassandra Getting Started](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted)\n",

If you expect your nodes to hold 500GB of data each, you\n  will need a 1TB partition. Using non-default compaction such as\n  LeveledCompactionStrategy can lower this waste.\n\n- Much more information can be found in the [Cassandra 2.2 documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/planning/planPlanningAbout.html)\n\n\n## Network Access\n\nThe default Cassandra packages are installed from the apache.org\narchive. To avoid this download, place a copy of the packages in a local\narchive and specify its location in the `install_sources` configuration\noption. The signing key is automatically added.\n\nWhen using DataStax Enterprise, you need to specify the archive location\ncontaining the DataStax Enterprise .deb packages in the\n`install_sources` configuration item, and the signing key in the\n`install_keys` configuration item. Place the DataStax packages in a\nlocal archive to avoid downloading from datastax.com.\n\n\n## Oracle Java SE\n\nCassandra recommends using Oracle Java SE 8. Unfortunately, this\nsoftware is accessible only after accepting Oracle's click-through\nlicense making deployments using it much more cumbersome. You will need\nto download the Oracle Java SE 8 Server Runtime for Linux, and place the\ntarball at a URL accessible to your deployed units. The config item\n`private_jre_url` needs to be set to this URL.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nTo relate the Cassandra charm to a service that understands how to talk to\nCassandra using Thrift or the native Cassandra protocol::\n\n    juju deploy cs:service-that-needs-cassandra\n    juju add-relation service-that-needs-cassandra cassandra:database\n\n\nAlternatively, if you require a superuser connection, use the\n`database-admin` relation instead of `database`::\n\n    juju deploy cs:admin-service\n    juju add-relation admin-service cassandra:database-admin\n\n\nClient charms need to provide nothing. The Cassandra service publishes the\nfollowing connection settings and cluster information on the client's relation:\n\n`username` and `password`:\n\n    Authentication credentials. The cluster is configured to use\n    the standard PasswordAuthenticator authentication provider, rather\n    than the insecure default. You can use different credentials\n    if you wish, using an account created through some other mechanism.\n\n`host`:\n\n    IP address to connect to.\n\n`native_transport_port`:\n\n    Port for drivers and tools using the newer native protocol.\n\n`rpc_port`:\n\n    Port for drivers and tools using the legacy Thrift protocol.\n\n`cluster_name`:\n\n    The cluster name. A client service may be related to several\n    Cassandra services, and this setting may be used to tell which\n    services belong to which cluster.\n\n`datacenter` and `rack`:\n\n    The datacenter and rack units in this service belong to. Required for\n    setting keyspace replication correctly.\n\nThe cluster is configured to use the recommended 'snitch'\n(GossipingPropertyFileSnitch), so you will need to configure replication of\nyour keyspaces using the NetworkTopologyStrategy replica placement strategy.\nFor example, using the default datacenter named 'juju':\n\n    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mydata WITH REPLICATION =\n    { 'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'juju': 3};\n\n\nAlthough authentication is configured using the standard\nPasswordAuthentication, by default no authorization is configured\nand the provided credentials will have access to all data on the cluster.\nFor more granular permissions, you will need to set the authorizer\nin the service configuration to CassandraAuthorizer and manually grant\npermissions to the users.\n\n\n# Known Limitations and Issues\n\nThis is the 'trusty' charm. Upgrade from the 'precise' charm is not supported.\n\nThe `system_auth` keyspace replication factor is automatically increased\nbut not decreased. If you have a service with three or more units and\ndecommission enough nodes to drop below three, you will need to manually\nupdate the `system_auth` keyspace replication settings.\n\n\n# Contact Information\n\n## Charm\n\n- [Cassandra Charm homepage](https://launchpad.net/cassandra-charm/)\n- [Source Code](https://code.launchpad.net/~cassandra-charmers/cassandra-charm/+git/cassandra-charm)\n- [Bug Reports](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cassandra-charm/)\n\n## Cassandra\n\n- [Apache Cassandra homepage](http://cassandra.apache.org/)\n- [Cassandra Getting Started](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted)\n",
