MQ Administrators can setup queue managers\nand queues. This will allow IBM MQ client application to transmit/receive messages.\n\nMore information on IBM MQ  available at the [Product Page][product-page]\nand [IBM Knowledge Center][mq-v8-info]\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nDownload (see below) your licensed IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 software and copy it to the\n`files/archives` directory of MQ charm.\n\nFor e.g:\n\n  * Go to the `files/archives` directory.\n\n  * Copy the `WS_MQ_8.0.0.2_FOR_LIN_ON_LE_POWER.tar.gz` file to this directory for\n    `POWER LE` base machines.  For `x86_64`, use `WS_MQ_V8.0.0.2_LINUX_ON_X86_64_I.tar.gz`.\n\n  * The file name you have could be different from the example above (but with the\n    `.gz` extension). Ensure a backup copy of the file.\n\nTo install the downloaded binaries you must agree to the IBM license.  The license\nfile(s) can be found under the `files/archives/licenses` directory on extraction\nof IBM MQ software using the following command:\n\n    tar xvfz *.gz  --strip-components=1\n\nThe license can also be viewed by running the following command after extracting\nIBM MQ to the files/archives directory:\n\n    ./mqlicense.sh -text_only\n\nRun the following to deploy this charm:\n\n    juju deploy ibm-mq\n\nAt this point the charm will wait until the user accepts the license.  If you\nagree to the license, run the following command:\n\n    juju set ibm-mq accept-ibm-mq-license=True\n\nIn order to create MQ objects like queue, it is required that some\nof the system configurations be updated. Details provided at\n[IBM Knowledge Center][mq-config-info].\n\nThe Charm updates the following system configuration:\n\n  * In `/etc/sysctl.conf`:\n\n        fs.file-max = 524288\n        kernel.shmmax = 268435456\n\n  * In `/etc/security/limits.conf`:\n\n        mqm              hard    nofile          10240\n        mqm              soft    nofile          10240\n\n  * Adds user `ubuntu` to group `mqm`.\n\nVerify these changes have been made successfully if MQ throws up any errors.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n`accept-ibm-mq-license`\nBefore you can use or install IBM MQ,\nyou must accept the terms of International License\nAgreement for Non-Warranted Programs and additional license information.\nPlease read the license agreement carefully.\n\nThe license file(s) can be found under the `files/archives` directory after\ndownloading and extracting IBM MQ there. The license can also be viewed by\nrunning the following command after extracting IBM MQ to the `files/archives`\ndirectory:\n      ./mqlicense.sh -text_only\n\nSet the value of accept-ibm-mq-license to True if you agree to IBM MQ license.\n\n**The IBM MQ software cannot be installed until the terms and\nconditions are accepted.  The charm will not function correctly until the\nthis configuration option is set to True.**\n\nKnown Limitations\n-----------------\n\nLocal providers does not allow updates to system configuration using sysctl\ncommand. These configurations will need be done manually for MQ to function.\nThe required configurations are provided in this document.\n\nIBM MQ Information\n-------------------\n\n### (1) General Information\n\nDetails about MQ available [here][mq-info].\n\nDetails about MQ Version 8.0 available at [IBM Knowledge Center][mq-v8-info].\n\n### (2) Download Information\n\nInformation on procuring MQ product is available at the [Product Page][product-page]\nand at the [Passport Advantage Site][passport].\n\nA development version for `x86_64` is available [here][dev-download].\nAfter clicking on the above link and if you agree to the license, click on\n'I agree' link to download the IBM MQ package.\n\nA 90 days trial version is available [here][trial-download].\n\n### (3) License Information\n\nLicense information for IBM MQ  is available as part of the downloaded product\npackage.
