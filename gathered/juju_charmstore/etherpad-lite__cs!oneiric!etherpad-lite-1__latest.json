It reuses the well tested Etherpad easysync library\nto make it really realtime.\n\nEtherpad Lite is based on node.js ergo is much lighter and more stable than\nthe original Etherpad. Our hope is that this will encourage more users to\nuse and install a realtime collaborative editor.\n\nA smaller, manageable and well documented codebase makes it easier for\ndevelopers to improve the code and contribute towards the project.\n\nEtherpad Lite is optimized to be eddasy embeddable. It provides a HTTP API\nthat allows your web application to manage pads, users and groups.
