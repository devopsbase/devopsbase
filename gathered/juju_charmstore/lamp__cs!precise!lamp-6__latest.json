The first thing the LAMP charm does is to install and configure a new instance with Apache and PHP5. The charm will then copy any files `/website`  inside the charm folder structure, into `/var/www` on the deployed instance.\n\n# Usage\n\nThis is an example deployment of the charm:\n\n1. Deploy Mysql as a service.\n\n        juju deploy mysql\n\n1. Deploy phpmyadmin, set a password, and then expose it.\n\n        juju deploy phpmyadmin\n        juju set phpmyadmin password=\"password\"\n        juju expose phpmyadmin\n\n1. Relate phpmyadmin and MySQL so they can talk to each other\n\n        juju add-relation phpmyadmin mysql\n\n1. Deploy LAMP from your local folder\n\n        charm get lamp\n\n    Now `cd lamp` and copy your PHP files into the `~/lamp/website` folder. Now deploy your application:\n\n        juju deploy --repository ~/lamp local:lamp\n\n1. Set up your bazaar branch and publish your website\n\n        juju set lamp website-bzr=\"lp:~vtuson/+junk/mytodo_web\"\n        juju expose lamp\n\n1. Configure your database and link LAMP and MySQL\n\n        juju set lamp website-database=\"your_db_name\"\n        juju add-relation lamp mysql\n\n# Configuration\n\nIt also allows you to specify a Bazaar branch. It will clone the branch into the webserver and copy the contents to `/var/www`. As an example set:\n\n    juju set lamp website-bzr=\"lp:~vtuson/+junk/mytodo_web\"\n\nYou can set up a relationship with a Mysql service. A Mysql database is created by default at this time. You can change the name of the database as a configuration options.\n\n    juju set lamp website-database=\"your_db_name\"\n\nIf you provide a file called mysql_config either on the `/website` folder or in the root of you Bazaar branch, this will be used to configure further the Mysql database. PLease note that this file is called every time a new unit is created. For example, item creation should first check if the table exists.\n\nThe charm will store the details of the relationship in `/var/webconfig`. In there you can also find opendb.php, a basic script that will open the connection to the MySQL database for you.\n\nIf you want to update the web service by pulling the latest version of the Bazaar branch, just run the following commands:\n\n    juju set lamp bzr-update=\"yes\"\n    juju set lamp bzr-update=\n\n# Contact Information\n\nThough this will be listed in the charm store itself don't assume a user will know that, so include that information here:\n\n## LAMP Charm\n\n- [Author's homepage](http://victorpalau.net/)\n- [Author's blog announcement](http://victorpalau.net/2012/09/10/a-juju-adventure-charming-lamp/)\n",
