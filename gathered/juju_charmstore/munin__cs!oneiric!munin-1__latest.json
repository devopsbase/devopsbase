  "description": "network-wide graphing framework (grapher/gatherer)\n\nMunin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs\nof virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while\nstill maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.\nThis package contains the grapher/gatherer. You will only need one\ninstance of it in your network. It will periodically poll all the\nnodes in your network it's aware of for data, which it in turn will\nuse to create graphs and HTML pages, suitable for viewing with your\ngraphical web browser of choice.  It is also able to alert you if any\nvalue is outside of a preset boundary, useful if you want to be\nalerted if a filesystem is about to grow full, for instance.  You can\ndo this by making Munin run an arbitrary command when you need to be\nalert it, or make use of the intrinsic Nagios support.  Munin is\nwritten in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent\nRRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a\nlink from <http://munin.projects.linpro.no/> to a live installation.\n",
