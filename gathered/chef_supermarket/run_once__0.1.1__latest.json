  "readme": "run_once Cookbook\n=================\nManage actions in cookbooks that should only run once in both chef-solo and\nchef-client.\n\nUsage\n-----\nTo use in your cookbooks, simply include the run_once recipe and use the\n`RunOnce.has_run?` and `RunOnce.ran` methods.\n\n    include_recipe 'run_once'\n\n    ruby_bock 'do-something' do\n      block do\n        # Your code\n        RunOnce.ran(:my_cookbook, :do_something)\n      end\n      not_if {RunOnce.has_run?(:my_cookbook, :do_something)}\n    end\n\nAttributes\n----------\nrun_once will determine which is the best way to store the run_once attributes\nbased upon which way the recipe is run. If it is used by a recipe run by chef-solo,\nthe attributes for run_once are kept in `/var/chef/cache/run_once.json`.  When used\nby a recipe run by chef-client, the node will have an tree of attributes under\n`[:run_once]` in the format `[:run_once][COOKBOOK][FLAG]`.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\nAuthor:: Gavin M.
