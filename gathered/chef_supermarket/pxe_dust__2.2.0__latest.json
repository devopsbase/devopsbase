  "readme": "# Description\n\nThis cookbook handles local bootstrapping and PXE booting life cycle:\n\n* **server**: Configures a tftpd server for serving Ubuntu and Debian installers over PXE.\n* **installers**: Downloads the Chef full stack installers and writes out Chef bootstraps.\n* **bootstrap_template**: Builds a template for use with `knife` to take advantage of the locally mirrored content.\n* **esxi**: Bootstraps ESXi via PXE at tftp.\n\n# Requirements\n\nRequires Chef 10.12 or later since it now uses the full-chef installer.\n\n## Platform:\n\nPlease refer to the [TESTING file](TESTING.md) to see the currently (and passing) tested platforms. The release was tested on:\n* Ubuntu 12.04\n* Ubuntu 14.04\n* Debian 6.0-7.1 (have with manual testing)\n* VMware-VMvisor-Installer-5.0.0.update03\n* VMware-VMvisor-Installer-201501001\n* VMware-VMvisor-Installer-6.0.0.update01 (The [boot.cfg](templates/default/esxi-boot.cfg.erb) is for this one)\n\n## Cookbooks:\n\nRequired: apache2, tftp\n\nOptional (recommended): apt (for `recipe[apt::cacher-ng]`).\n\nDO NOT USE `chef-client::delete-validator` in conjunction with this cookbook, since it uses the validation.pem to help bootstrap new machines.\n\n# pxe_dust Data Bag\n\nIn order to manage configuration of machines registering themselves with their Chef Server or Chef Software Hosted Chef, we will use the `pxe_dust` data bag.\n\n```\n% knife data bag create pxe_dust\n% knife data bag from file pxe_dust examples/default.json\n```\n\nHere is an example of the default.json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"default\",\n    \"platform\": \"ubuntu\",\n    \"arch\": \"amd64\",\n    \"version\": \"14.04\",\n    \"user\": {\n        \"fullname\": \"Ubuntu\",\n        \"username\": \"ubuntu\",\n        \"crypted_password\": \"$6$Trby4Y5R$bi90k7uYY5ImXe5MWGFW9kel2BnMCcYO9EnwngTFIXKG2/nWcLKTJZ3verMFnpFbITI9.eHwZ.HR1UPeKbCAV1\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAny settings provided by the data bag may be overridden by setting `['pxe_dust']['default']` attributes, for example:\n\n    node['pxe_dust']['default']['environment'] = 'qa'\n\nHere are currently supported options available for inclusion in the example `default.json`:\n\n* `platform`: OS platform for the installer, (ie. 'ubuntu' or 'debian').\n* `arch`: Architecture of the netboot.tar.gz to use as the source of pxeboot images, default is 'amd64'.\n* `interface`: Which interface to install from, default is 'auto'.\n* `version`: Ubuntu version of the netboot.tar.gz to use as the source of pxeboot images and full stack clients, default is '12.04'.\n* `domain`: Default domain for nodes, default is none.\n* `boot_volume_size`: Size of the LVM boot volume to create, default is '30GB'.\n* `packages`: Additional operating system packages to add to the preseed file, default is none.\n* `run_list`: Run list for nodes, this value is NOT set as a default and will be passed to all boot types unless explicitly overwritten.\n* `environment`: Environment for nodes, this value is NOT set as a default and will be passed to all boot types unless explicitly overwritten.\n* `netboot_url`: URL of the netboot image to use for OS installation.\n* `bootstrap`: Optional additional bootstrapping configuration.\n    `http_proxy`: HTTP proxy, default is none.\n    `http_proxy_user`: HTTP proxy user, default is none.\n    `http_proxy_pass`: HTTP proxy pass, default is none.\n    `https_proxy`: HTTPS proxy, default is none.\n* `chef`: Whether or not to bootstrap the node with Chef, default is 'true'.\n* `halt`: Whether to wait for user input at end of bootstrap, default is 'false'.\n* `user`:\n    `crypted_password`: SHA512 password for the default user, default 'ubuntu'. This may be generated and added to the data bag.\n    `fullname`: Full name of the default user, default 'Ubuntu'.\n    `username`: Username of the default user, default 'ubuntu'.\n* `root`:\n    `crypted_password`: SHA512 password for the root user, default 'ubuntu'. This is used on Debian since Ubuntu does not have a root.\n* `external_preseed`: Direct pxeboot clients to an existing (unmanaged by pxe_dust) preseed file.\n\nAdditional data bag items may be used to support booting multiple operating systems. Examples of various Ubuntu and Debian installations are included in the `examples` directory. Important to note is the use of the `addresses` option to support tftp booting by MAC address (this is currently required for not using the default) and the explicit need for a `run_list` and/or an `environment` if one is to be provided.\n\n# Templates\n\n## pxelinux.cfg.erb\n\nSets the URL to the preseed file, architecture, the domain and which interfaces to use.\n\n## preseed.cfg.erb\n\nThe preseed file is full of opinions mostly exposed via attributes, you will want to update this. If there is a node providing an apt-cacher-ng caching proxy via `recipe[apt::cacher-ng]`, it is provided in the preseed.cfg. The initial user and password is configured and any additional required packages may be added to the `pxe_dust` data bag items. The preseed finishes by calling the `chef-bootstrap` script.\n\n## chef-bootstrap.sh.erb\n\nThis is the `preseed/late_command` that bootstraps the node with Chef via the full stack installer.\n\n## esxi-ks.cfg.erb\n\nThis is a basic kickstart to bootstrap ESXi 6.0. It installs ESXi on the main harddrive and enables DHCP on the first NIC.\n\n## esxi-boot.cfg.erb\n\nThis is the boot.cfg for ESXi 6.0 to work with the tftp setup with this cookbook.\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\nThe default recipe includes recipe `pxe_dust::server`.\n\n## server\n\n`recipe[pxe_dust::server]` includes the `apache2`, `tftp::server` and `pxe_dust::bootstrap_template` recipes.\n\nThe recipe does the following:\n\n1. Downloads the proper netboot.tar.gzs to boot from.\n2. Untars them to the `['tftp']['directory']` directory.\n3. Instructs the installer prompt to automatically install.\n4. Passes the URL of the preseed.cfgs to the installer.\n5. Uses the preseed.cfg template to pass in any `apt-cacher-ng` caching proxies or other additional settings.\n\n## installers\n\nDownloads the full stack installers listed in the `pxe_dust` data bag and writes out the Chef bootstrap templates for the initial chef-client run connecting to the Chef server.\n\n## esxi\n\nThis recipe sets up PXE to help deploy ESXi from VMware. You need to acquire the\nISO from VMWare before running this recipe. There is an attribute `default['pxe_dust']['esx_iso']`\nthat defaults to: `VMware-VMvisor-Installer-6.0.0.update01-3029758.x86_64.iso` which at the time\nof creating this recipe was the most up-to-date. You may need to override this with\na different version so keep that in mind. If you put that ISO in the `/tmp` directory\non the tftp machine the recipe will take the ISO and extract what it needs and\nadd the option to the PXE boot menu. You can start up the machine and select the\n3rd menu label and boot into installing ESXi on that host.\n\nThe root password is `Ubuntu!!` due to the ESXi security restrictions.\n\nThis recipe has been tested from ESXi `5.0`,`5.5`,`6.0 update 1`.\n\n## bootstrap_template\n\nThis recipe creates a bootstrap template that uses a local `install.sh` that uses the cached full stack installers from the `installers` recipe. It may then be downloaded from `http://NODE/NODE.erb` and put in your `.chef/bootstrap/` directory for use with `knife`. You may also use the `http://NODE/NODE-install.sh` if you want a local `install.sh`, perhaps for use with [https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus](vagrant-omnibus)'s `OMNIBUS_INSTALL_URL` setting.\n\n# Usage\n\nAdd `recipe[pxe_dust::server]` to a node's or role's run list. Create the `pxe_dust` data bag and update the `defaults.json` item before adding it.\n\nOn an Ubuntu system, the password can be generated by installing the `mkpasswd` package and running:\n\n    mkpasswd -m sha-512\n\nThe default is the hash of the password `ubuntu`, if you'd like to test. This must be set in the `pxe_dust` data bag to a valid sha-512 hash of the password or you will not be able to log in.\n\nIf you do not need PXE booting, you may still want to use the `pxe_dust::installers` and `pxe_dust::bootstrap_template` for bootstrapping nodes (like with LXC or Vagrant).\n\nIf you would like to bootstrap ESXi, add the node run_list `recipe[pxe_dust::esxi]` after you've done the previous steps,\nyou'll get a new menu item to bootstrap into ESXi, with a [kickstart](templates/default/esxi-ks.cfg.erb) that sets everything up as DHCP.\n\n# Attributes\n\n- `node['pxe_dust']['chefversion']` the Chef version that pxe_dust should provide, unset by default which downloads latest\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dir']` the location where apache will serve pxe_dust content, default is '/var/www/pxe_dust'\n- `node['pxe_dust']['default']` attributes that may be used to override any settings provided by the `pxe_dust` data bag items\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_server']` defaults to `true` where this cookbook will set up a dhcp server for you.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_interface']` defaults to `eth1` as the interface you want your dhcp server to listen on.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_subnet']` defaults to `192.168.10.0` as the subnet that the leases will be.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_netmask']` defaults to `255.255.255.0` as the netmask for the leases.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_range']` defaults to `192.168.10.20 192.168.10.100` as the range of the leases.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_dns']`  defaults to `192.168.1.1, 8.8.8.8` as your offered DNS servers.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_domain']` defaults to an `example.com` domain.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_gateway']` defaults to the `192.168.10.1` as your externally routed address.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_broadcast']`  defaults to `192.168.10.255` as the broadcast address.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_lease_time']` defaults to `600` as your minimum lease time.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_max_lease_time']` defaults to `7200` as your max lease time.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['dhcpd_next_server']` defaults to your tftp server `192.168.10.1`\n- `node['pxe_dust']['esxi_iso]` The name of the VMWare ESXi ISO that you'd like to install. The recipe expects it in `/tmp` of the machine that will host the tftp server.\n- `node['pxe_dust']['esxi_rootpasswd']` defaults to `Ubuntu!!`, you can override it here.\n\n# License and Author\n\n|                      |                                        |\n|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n| **Author**           | JJ Asghar (<jj@chef.io>)          |\n| **Author**           | Matt Ray (<matt@chef.io>)          |\n| **Author**           | Joshua Timberman <joshua@chef.io>  |\n|                      |                                        |\n| **Copyright**        | Copyright (c) 2011-2016, Chef Software, Inc. |\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
