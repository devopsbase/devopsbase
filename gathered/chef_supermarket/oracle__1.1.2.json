  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls and configures the Oracle RDBMS, patches it to the latest\nversion and creates databases.\n\nNew features in version v1.1.0\n\n* Configure the EM dbconsole (Enterprise Manager Database Control)\n* Install Oracle Client and patch it to the latest patch\n\nTested with an Open Source Chef Server/Chef Client combo only.\n\nOracle version 11.2.0.3 was used to develop this cookbook, but the\ncode should work for other versions as well, with some\nmodifications.\n\nAt the time this cookbook was being developed the latest patch was\nPatch 14727310 - 11.2.0.3.5, but it has now been updated to the\nlatest patch from Oracle 7/16/2013, Patch 16619892 - 11.2.0.3.7\nPatch Set Update.\n\nFor guidelines on how to adapt the cookbook for other PSU versions,\nsee `latest_dbpatch`, under `Recipes`, below.\n\nQuickstart (database)\n=====================\n\n* Have either an open Source Chef Server or a Hosted Chef account at\n  the ready.\n* Spin up a CentOS VM using your choice of hypervisor and/or Vagrant,\n  and the `CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal.iso`, which you can get here:\n\n  [`CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal.iso`](https://www.centos.org/)\n\n* Your NIC is not up by default, make sure to edit the\n  `/etc/sysconfig/ifcfg-eth0` file and run `service network start`.\n* Make sure your FQDN is properly configured (test this with\n  `hostname -f`), else `runInstaller` will fail.\n* You don't want to transfer Oracle's binaries in the clear across\n  the Internet. Set up a Web server to serve them over HTTPS unless\n  you're on a secure local network.\n* Create a role to override the default attribute values for the URLs\n  of Oracle's install files & patches with your own; e.g.:\n\n        name \"ora_quickstart\"\n        description \"Role applied to Oracle quickstart test machines.\"\n        run_list 'recipe[oracle]', 'recipe[oracle::logrotate_alert_log]', 'recipe[oracle::logrotate_listener]', 'recipe[oracle::createdb]'\n        override_attributes :oracle => {:rdbms => {:latest_patch => {:url => 'https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p16619892_112030_Linux-x86-64.zip'}, :opatch_update_url => 'https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p6880880_112000_Linux-x86-64.zip', :install_files => ['https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_1of7.zip', 'https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_2of7.zip']}} \n\n* You need to set up an encrypted data bag item to secure the oracle\n  user's password. See Opscode's docs site for details on encrypted\n  data bags:\n  [encrypted data bag doc](http://docs.opscode.com/chef/essentials_data_bags.html#encrypt-a-data-bag)\n  Your encrypted item requires a key named `pw`, whose value is the\n  password of the oracle user- you can set that to whatever you want.\n  You must set the value of `node[:oracle][:user][:edb]` to the name\n  of your data bag, and that of `node[:oracle][:user][:edb_item]` to\n  the name of the encrypted item; the defaults are `oracle` and\n  `foo`, respectively.\n\n* If you're using the open source Chef Server, add this line to\n  /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb:\n\n        `erchef['s3_url_ttl'] = 9999`\n\n  then run `chef-server-ctl reconfigure` to reconfigure Chef Server.\n  This config edit avoids running into CHEF-3045, which we are liable\n  to do because of the time it takes to install Oracle's binaries and\n  spin up a database.\n\n* Bootstrap the node, telling Chef to create the FOO database on it:\n\n        knife bootstrap HOSTNAME -r 'role[ora_quickstart]' -j '{\"oracle\" : {\"rdbms\": {\"dbs\": {\"FOO\" : false}}}}'\n\n* Go grab a cup of tea, as this is apt to take a fair amount of time\nto complete :-)\n\n\nQuickstart (client)\n===================\n\n* Follow the steps above to create a VM\n\n* Create a role to override the default attribute values for the URLs\n  of Oracle Client's install files & patches with your own; e.g.:\n\n  **Note**, that you need only one install file for the client: `p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_4of7.zip`\n\n        name \"ora_cli_quickstart\"\n        description \"Role applied to Oracle Client quickstart test machines.\"\n        run_list 'recipe[oracle::oracli]'\n        override_attributes :oracle => {:client => {:latest_patch => {:url => 'https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p16619892_112030_Linux-x86-64.zip'}, :opatch_update_url => 'https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p6880880_112000_Linux-x86-64.zip', :install_files => ['https://secure.server.localdomain/path/to/p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_4of7.zip']}} \n\n* You need to set up an encrypted data bag item to secure the oracli\n  user's password. See Opscode's docs site for details on encrypted\n  data bags:\n  [encrypted data bag doc](http://docs.opscode.com/chef/essentials_data_bags.html#encrypt-a-data-bag)\n  Your encrypted item requires a key named `pw`, whose value is the\n  password of the oracli user- you can set that to whatever you want.\n  You must set the value of `node[:oracle][:cliuser][:edb]` to the name\n  of your data bag, and that of `node[:oracle][:cliuser][:edb_item]` to\n  the name of the encrypted item; the defaults are `oracli` and\n  `foo`, respectively.\n\n* If you have already bootstrapped a node with the ora_quickstart role,\n  you can easily add the `role[ora_cli_quickstart]` role to the run\n  list.\n\n        knife node run_list add <node_name> 'role[ora_cli_quickstart]'\n\n* Otherwise just, bootstrap the node to install the client on it:\n\n        knife bootstrap HOSTNAME -r 'role[ora_cli_quickstart]'\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n## Oracle\n\nSee here:\n\n[Oracle's requirements](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e24321/pre_install.htm#i1011296)\n\n## Chef\n\nThis cookbook was successfully tested using Chef-Client 11, in combo\nwith the open source Chef Server 11, as well as with Hosted Chef.\n\nVersion 1.1.0 has been tested against Chef-Client (11.10.0 and 11.10.4)\nand open source Chef Server 11.\n\nIf you use the open source Chef Server, because installing a\ndatabase takes a long while, and owing to\n[CHEF-3045](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3045), you'll want\nto increase the value of `erchef['s3_url_ttl']` in\n`/etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb`; which value to choose depends on the\nnumber of databases you create, and how fast your nodes are. In most\ncases, this should give you room to spare to install a couple\ndatabases:\n\n`erchef['s3_url_ttl'] = 9999`\n\nthen run `chef-server-ctl reconfigure` to reconfigure Chef Server.\n\n## Platforms\n\n* `CentOS 6.5 (x86_64)`\n* `RHEL 6.5 (x86_64)`\n\noracle was tested on the distros/versions given above; YMMV on\nolder versions of their 6.x branches.\nThe development target was `Centos x86_64 minimal install`.\nDISCLAIMER: note that, out of these platforms, Oracle Database\n11g R2 is only certified on RHEL 6 :-) For more detail, check the\ncertification matrix on My Oracle Support:\n[certification matrix](https://support.oracle.com)\n\n## Packages\n\n* Access to My Oracle Support to download the 11.2.0.3 install media\n  and the patch files.\n\n  You will not be able to download the 11.2.0.3 install files from\n  Oracle Technology Network (OTN), since the version available there\n  is 11.2.0.1. From:\n  [Oracle DB Downloads page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html)\n\n  > \"11/10/11: Patch Set 11.2.0.3 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, AIX\n  and HP-UX Itanium is now available on support.oracle.com. Note: it\n  is a full installation (you do not need to download 11.2.0.1\n  first). See the README for more info (login to My Oracle Support\n  required).\"\n\n  For this version of the cookbook, you'll need the following\n  packages:\n\n  Patch 16619892 (11.2.0.3.7): `p16619892_112030_Linux-x86-64.zip`  \n  OPatch 6880880 (11.2.0.3.4): `p6880880_112000_Linux-x86-64.zip`  \n  Oracle 11.2.0.3 media: `p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_1of7.zip`  \n  Oracle 11.2.0.3 media: `p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_2of7.zip`  \n  Oracle 11.2.0.3 media: `p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_4of7.zip`\n\n  **Note:** You don't need all seven 11.2.0.3 media files in order to\n  just install the RDBMS' binaries. `p10404530_112030_Linux-x86-64_4of7.zip`\n  is for the client install.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n* Ensure that your FQDN is properly configured (check the output of\n  `hostname -f`), else runInstaller will fail.\n* At least a basic knowledge of Oracle administration will come in\n  handy, in particular if you want to modify attributes' values\n  and/or modify the cookbook's code or resources.\n* If you want to increase the size of `/dev/shm`, edit `/etc/fstab`\n  accordingly, and make sure to add this entry to `/etc/rc.local` or\n  `/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit` to have your changes persist across reboots:\n\n  `/bin/mount -o remount /dev/shm`\n\n  This works around a bug in RHEL and derivatives:\n  [Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 669700](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=669700)\n\n* Please check Oracle database specific swap recommendations from:\n  [3.1 Memory Requirements](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e24326/toc.htm#BHCJCBAF)\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\noracle defines a single top-level namespace: `:oracle`.

Its password is only set if\n`node[:oracle][:user][:pw_set]`'s value isn't true .\n`node[:oracle][:user][:pw_set]`'s value is `false` by default; it's\nflipped to `true` after we set the password, meaning that, if you want\nto change the password after the first Chef run, you'll have to flip\nit back.\n\nThe recipe expects the oracle user password to be stored in an\nencrypted data bag item; the bag's name is controlled by the\n`node[:oracle][:user][:edb]` attribute, whose default value is\n`oracle`. The item's name is controlled by the `node[:oracle][:user][:edb_item]`\nattribute, whose default value is `foo`.\n\nThe recipe requires the encrypted item to include a key named `pw`,\nwhose value you must set to the oracle user's password.\n\nFor more detail on encrypted data bags, see:\n[Opscode's doc on encrypted data bags](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags_encrypt.html)\n\n## `oracli_user_config`\n\nCreate and configure the oracli user. Its password is only set if\n`node[:oracle][:cliuser][:pw_set]`'s value isn't true .\n`node[:oracle][:cliuser][:pw_set]`'s value is `false` by default; it's\nflipped to `true` after we set the password, meaning that, if you want\nto change the password after the first Chef run, you'll have to flip\nit back.\n\nThe recipe expects the oracli user password to be stored in an\nencrypted data bag item; the bag's name is controlled by the\n`node[:oracle][:cliuser][:edb]` attribute, whose default value is\n`oracli`. The item's name is controlled by the `node[:oracle][:cliuser][:edb_item]`\nattribute, whose default value is `foo`.\n\nThe recipe requires the encrypted item to include a key named `pw`,\nwhose value you must set to the oracli user's password.\n\nFor more detail on encrypted data bags, see:\n[Opscode's doc on encrypted data bags](http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags_encrypt.html)\n\n## `deps_install`\n\nInstalls the Oracle RDBMS' dependencies, which are specified as an\nArray of package names that's the value of `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:deps]`.\n\n## `deps_cli_install`\n\nInstalls the Oracle Client' dependencies, which are specified as an\nArray of package names that's the value of `node[:oracle][:client][:deps]`.\n\n## `kernel_params`\n\nConfigures kernel parameters for Oracle. We deploy a config file to\n`/etc/sysctl.d/ora_params` and reload `sysctl` settings.\n\n## `ora_os_setup`\n\nIncludes 3 recipes, which are, in order:\n\n* `oracle::oracle_user_config`\n* `oracle::deps_install`\n* `oracle::kernel_params`\n\nThe recipe will set up the oracle user, install Oracle's dependencies\nand tweak the kernel's parameters.\n\n## `dbbin`\n\nInstalls Oracle RDBMS binaries. The install files are specified as\nan Array of URLs that's the value of the `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:install_files]`\nattribute.\n\n**Note:** If you use the `ora_quickstart` role, it will override the values.\n\n## `clibin`\n\nInstalls Oracle Client binaries. The install files are specified as\nan Array of URLs that's the value of the `node[:oracle][:client][:install_files]`\nattribute.\n\n**Note:** If you use the `ora_cli_quickstart` role, it will override the values.\n\n## `latest_dbpatch`\n\nInstalls latest patch for Oracle RDBMS. The patch file is specified\nas a URL that's the value of `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:latest_patch][:url]`.\n\nApplying Patch 16902043 with `latest_dbpatch.rb` has not been tested,\nbut it should work, just by setting `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:latest_patch][:url]`\nto the proper URL, pointing at that patch on your HTTPS server.\n\nAlso remember to update OPatch 6880880 to the latest version.\n\nPrevious or new PSU patches should work without many changes. 11.2.0.3.4,\n11.2.0.3.7 and 11.2.0.3.8 worked fine in our environment.\n\n## `cli_latest_patch`\n\nInstalls latest patch for Oracle Client. The patch file is specified\nas a URL that's the value of `node[:oracle][:client][:latest_patch][:url]`.\n\nApplying Patch 16902043 with `cli_latest_patch.rb` has not been tested,\nbut it should work, just by setting `node[:oracle][:client][:latest_patch][:url]`\nto the proper URL, pointing at that patch on your HTTPS server.\n\nAlso remember to update OPatch 6880880 to the latest version.\n\nPrevious or new PSU patches should work without many changes. 11.2.0.3.4,\n11.2.0.3.7 and 11.2.0.3.8 worked fine in our environment.\n\n## `get_version`\n\nIncluded by `latest_dbpatch`. Populates `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:install_info]`'s\nHash with key/value pairs that track the patch number, the patch's\ntimestamp, and the version string, as extracted from the output of:\n\n`opatch lsinventory -bugs_fixed`\n\n## `get_cli_version`\n\nIncluded by `cli_latest_patch`. Populates `node[:oracle][:client][:install_info]`'s\nHash with key/value pairs that track the patch number, the patch's\ntimestamp, and the version string, as extracted from the output of:\n\n`opatch lsinventory -bugs_fixed`\n\n## `createdb`\n\nCreates databases. Iterates over the keys of the `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:dbs]`'s\nHash, creating a database for each key whose value isn't truthy.\nYou're meant to specify this Hash yourself, for example in a role,\nor as part of the bootstrap command line, e.g.:\n\n`[snip] -j '{\"oracle\" : {\"rdbms\": {\"dbs\": {\"FOO\" : false}}}}'`\n\nThe value associated with a key is set to `true` after its\ncorresponding database has been created.\n\n## `logrotate_alert_log`\n\nlogrotate config for the Oracle alert log.\n\n## `logrotate_listener`\n\nlogrotate config for the Oracle listener's log.\n\n\nUsage Notes\n===========\n\n* You can customise most installation paths and related settings;\n  see the Attributes section, above, for details.\n* Database is installed on the root (`/`) filesystem. DBAs are\n  encouraged to improve the disk/fs layout as they see fit, and/or\n  to fit local practice.\n* The database template (created by DBCA) is not an Oracle best\n  practise, feel free to replace it with one of your own creation.\n* The database filesystem root is parameterised, using `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:dbs_root]`.\n  This attribute is leveraged in the database template we ship. If\n  you want to do the same with your own database template, you'll\n  have to turn it into a Chef template as well (and use\n  search-and-replace).\n* Replace the default ocm.rsp with your own, if you want to add your\n  email address for updates. Use the `$ORACLE_HOME/OPatch/ocm/bin/emocmrsp`\n  command to do that (pass it the `-help` switch to check its usage).\n  Then put the new reponse file on your HTTPS server and set\n  `node[:oracle][:rdbms][:response_file_url]` to the file's URL.\n* `dbbin` takes a long time to complete; hence the potential issue\n  with CHEF-3045 for open source Chef Server users.\n* By default the em console will be configured, so this will extend the\n  total run time even further (between versions 1.0.4 and 1.1.0). You\n  can turn it off from the `attributes/detault.rb`.\n* On a similar note, `createdb` supports the creation of several DBs\n  on the same host, but this is apt to take a small eternity to\n  complete.\n* The supplementary group `oinstall` for oracli is to align the permissions\n  to access /opt/oraInventory.\n\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nFor v1.2.0\n\n* Update the latest patch to 11.2.0.3.x.\n* Node attribute isolation to rdbms or oracli depending on which is\n  installed.\n* Ability to patch existing installations (patchbin.rb)\n\nFor v1.3.0\n\n* Add OEM 11g agent installation\n\nFor v2.0.0\n\n* Re-factor and re-architecture the cookbook\n* LWRP's\n* Modular\n* Dynamic choice of Orcle version\n* Use of remote_file resources\n\nFor v2.1.0\n\n* 12c support\n\nFor v3.0.0\n\n* RAC support on NFS\n* RAC support on ASM\n\nAdditional Info\n===============\n\nAri has a blog where he gets into more detail about our testing\nof oracle cookbook on two cloud providers (using Hosted Chef), and Chefy\nand Oracly things generally:\n\n<http://oraarir.blogspot.fi/>\n\nContributing\n===========\n\n1.
