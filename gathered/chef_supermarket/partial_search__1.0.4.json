  "readme": "Partial Search Cookbook\n=======================\nPartial Search is a new search API currently available only on Opscode\nHosted Chef that can be used to reduce the network bandwidth and the\nmemory used by chef-client to process search results.\n\nThis cookbook provides an experimental interface to the partial search\nAPI by providing a `partial_search` method that can be used instead of\nthe `search` method in your recipes.\n\nThe `partial_search` method allows you to retrieve just the attributes\nof interest. For example, you can execute a search to return just the\nname and IP addresses of the nodes in your infrastructure rather than\nreceiving an array of complete node objects and post-processing them.\n\nFinally, both the `search` and `partial_search` methods allow you to\ncache results to avoid repetitive queries for the same search terms.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\nUpload this cookbook and include it in the dependencies of any\ncookbook where you would like to use `partial_search`.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nWhen you call `partial_search`, you need to specify the key paths of the\nattributes you want returned. Key paths are specified as an array\nof strings. Each key path is mapped to a short name of your\nchoosing. Consider the following example:\n\n```ruby\npartial_search(:node, 'role:web',\n   :keys => { 'name' => [ 'name' ],\n              'ip'   => [ 'ipaddress' ],\n              'kernel_version' => [ 'kernel', 'version' ]\n            }\n).each do |result|\n  puts result['name']\n  puts result['ip']\n  puts result['kernel_version']\nend\n```\n\nIn the example above, two attributes will be extracted (on the\nserver) from the nodes that match the search query. The result will\nbe a simple hash with keys 'name'  and 'ip'.\n\nThe `:cache` option allows you to retrieve cached search results if available.\nIf an identical query was already issued during the current Chef run, its\nresults will be immediately returned, thereby avoiding an unnecessary\nround-trip to the server.  For example:\n\n```ruby\npartial_search(:node, 'role:web', cache: true, keys: ...)\n```\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n* We would like your feedback on this feature and the interface\n  provided by this cookbook. Please send comments to the chef-dev\n  mailing list.\n\n* The partial search API will eventually be available in the Open Source Chef\n  Server.\n\n* The partial search API is available in Opscode Private Chef since\n  1.2.2\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Adam Jacob (<adam@opscode.com>)\n- Author:: John Keiser (<jkeiser@opscode.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2012-2013, Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n"
