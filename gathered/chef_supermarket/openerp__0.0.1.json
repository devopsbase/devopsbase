  "readme": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nInstalls and configures OpenERP server, web-client and database.\n\n= STATUS:\n\nAlthough the rest of the document indicates that this cookbook can install OpenERP in\na distributed setup, the current version only supports installing everything on the same machine.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n== Platform:\n\nTested on the following platforms:\n- Ubuntu 10.04.1.\n\nTested with the following OpenERP versions:\n- 6.0.0\n\nOpen for patches to support more systems out of the box! Clone the repo, implement your changes and\nsubmit a pull request. The upstream repo lives here:\n\nhttps://github.com/atriso/chef-openerp\n\n== Cookbooks:\n\n= ATTRIBUTES: \n\n* openerp[:version] - Version of openerp to use.\n\n= USAGE:\n\nThis cookbook provides a complete OpenERP setup in two ways:\n\n- everything on a single host: database, OpenERP server and web-client installed on a single machine\n     and configured correctly to be instantly usable.\n- distributed over multiple machines: database, OpenERP server and web-client can be spread\n     over multiple machines. The three components will be configured to work together based on the\n     results of a Chef search. This requires Chef Server to function correctly.\n\nThis cookbook doesn't configure an http proxy against the OpenERP web-client. To prevent too much\nassumptions on the specific user setup, it was chosen to not provide that in this cookbook.\n\n== Single-host\n\nThe simplest way to install the complete OpenERP stack, including PostgreSQL, is to use the\nsingle-host way. Either include the default OpenERP recipe in your own cookbook, add this\nrecipe to your node run list or add it to the run list of a role.\n\ninclude 'openerp'\n\nWithout any other options, this will install OpenERP 6.0.0. If you want to install another version,\njust override the default version, e.g in a role definition via the Ruby DSL:\n\noverride_attributes \"openerp\" => { \"version\" => \"6.0.1\" }\n\n== Distributed\n\nIn the distributed setup, you can install every component of the OpenERP stack on a different machine.\nThe components will be connected to each other based on the result of a Chef search. The search criterium\nused will be the node's run list. For example, the OpenERP server will be configured to the database\nserver using the node information containing the 'openerp::database' recipe in it's run list.\n\n== Installing & Configuring the database server:\n\ninclude 'openerp::database'\n\nThis recipe will relay the PostgreSQL installation to the 'postgresql' cookbook. After the installation\nof the PostgreSQL server, the OpenERP database user is created with the proper access rights.\n\n== Server recipe:\n\ninclude 'openerp::server'\n\n== Web-client recipe:\n\ninclude 'openerp::webclient'\n\n= LICENSE and AUTHOR:\n      \nAuthor:: Ringo De Smet (<ringo.de.smet@atriso.be>)\n\nCopyright:: 2011, Atriso, BVBA\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
