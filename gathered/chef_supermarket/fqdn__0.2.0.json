  "readme": "# fqdn cookbook\n\n# STATUS\nThis cookbook is not yet ready for use in production. It should only\nbe used in testing situations such as cookbook development.\nSpecifically, the line editing library it depends on contains bugs\nand will edit files over multiple runs in certain circumstances.\n\n# Description\nThere is an unfortunate amount of confusion and misunderstanding\naround the term FQDN. The acronym stands for \"Fully Qualified Domain\nName\". This leads to some confusion about the relationship between it\nand a hostname. It would be better called \"Fully Qualified DNS Host Name\".\n\nOn linux, it is found by issuing the command `hostname -f`. On\nSolaris, there is no such thing, but you can set a dnsdomain name.\n\nLinux will only return data when the proper bits are aligned in\n/etc/hosts. The order of these bits need to be in is determined by the\nversion of glibc on the system. Solaris works a different way. Don't\neven get me started on Windows.\n\nHow this gets set initially comes from many different directions. Some\nEnterprises will keep a standard naming scheme and inject hostnames\nand fqdns into hosts during provisioning. Some Cloud providers will\nsupply you with forward and reverse DNS, visible from the running\nsystem. Some wont. Sometimes you get a machine who's hostname is set to\n\"computer\" with no notion of being on a DNS domain at all.\n\nLots of server software breaks when a machine's FQDN is not properly\nset. Chef recipes that refer to the FQDN attribute will error Ohai is\nunable to determine what the FQDN should be.\n\nFrankly, the whole thing is a mess.\n\nThis cookbook aims to easily set an FQDN on machines where it is not\nproperly set out of the box.\n\n# Attributes\n```\ndefault['machine_fqdn'] = nil\ndefault['machine_fqdn_as_hostname'] = true\n```\n\n# Behavior\nIf included in the run_list, `fqdn::default` will attempt to repair\nthe machine's FQDN based on user supplied data. If the attribute\n`node['machine_fqdn']` is set, it will use the string found there to\nattempt to configuration the machine's hostname.\n\nIf node['machine_fqdn_as_hostname'] is set to true (it is by default),\nit will configure the machine such that the hostname command returns\nthe full DNS path to the machine. That is, `hostname` and `hostname\n-f` will return the same things on Linux machines.\n\n# Requirements\n```\nline cookbook\nhostsfile cookbook\n```\n\n# Usage\n`include_recipe 'fqdn'`\n\n# Recipes\ndebian.rb\nrhel.rb\n\n# Author\nAuthor:: Sean OMeara (<someara@opscode.com>)\n",
