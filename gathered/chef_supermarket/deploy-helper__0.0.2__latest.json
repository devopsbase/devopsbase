  "readme": "deploy-helper Cookbook\n======================\nIt leaves the application deployment purely in the\nhands of the developer.  It provides a clean way to\ngather deployment details from an application repo\nthat can then be used during the primary application\ndeployment.\n\nThis is very basic and only supports git at the moment.\n\nUsage\n-----\nAdd a .deploy.yml file to the git application repo\nyou plan to use for an application deployment and\nuse the helper method.\n\n```yaml\n---\nrevision:\n  default: master\n  production: prod\n  staging: staging\n  dev: dev\nmigrate:\n  default: false\n  proudction: true\n```\n\nThe helper method returns a mash of the yaml info,\nthat should represent the Chef environment so if\nrevision is set for production but not master it\nwill just use whatever the default is.\n\n```ruby\napp_repo = 'git@github.com:jarosser06/magic'\ndeploy_key = data_bag_item('secrets', 'deploy_key')\napp_info = git_deployment_info(app_repo, deploy_key['key'])\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n1.
