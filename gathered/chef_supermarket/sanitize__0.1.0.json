  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook aims to normalize setup of a fresh server and set sane\ndefaults for global settings, and work with various initial\nenvironments (tested on EC2 images, Hetzner \"minimal\" installations,\nand debootstrap-created LXC images). At the moment it supports only\nUbuntu, Debian support is planned.\n\nThis cookbook is developed on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/3ofcoins/chef-cookbook-sanitize\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* apt\n* build-essential\n* iptables\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `sanitize.iptables` -- if false, does not install and configure\n  iptables; defaults to true.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[sanitize]` in your run list after your user accounts\nare created and sudo and ssh is configured.\n\nsanitize::default\n-----------------\n\nThis is the default \"base settings\" setup. It should be called\n**after** shell user accounts and sudo are configured, as it locks\ndefault login user and direct root access.\n\n1. Deletes `ubuntu` system user\n2. Locks system password for `root` user (assumes that only sudo is\n   used to elevate privileges)\n3. Ensure all FHS-provided directories exist by creating some that\n   have been found missing on some of the installation (namely,\n   `/opt`)\n4. Sets locale to `en_US.UTF-8`, generates this locale, sets time zone\n   to UTC\n5. Changes mode of `/var/log/chef/client.log` to `0600` -- readable\n   only for root, as it may contain sensitive data\n6. Deletes annoying `motd.d` files\n7. Installs vim and sets it as a default system editor\n8. Installs and configures iptables, opens SSH port (optional, but\n   enabled by default)\n9. Installs `can-has` command as a symlink to `apt-get`\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nPlans for future, in no particular order:\n\n* Depend on and include `openssh-server`; configure SSH known hosts,\n  provide sane SSH server and client configuration defaults\n* Provide hooks (definitions / LWRP / library) for other cookbooks for\n  commonly used facilities, such as opening up common ports, \"backend\"\n  http service, SSL keys management, maybe some other \"library\"\n  functions like helpers for encrypted data bags\n",
