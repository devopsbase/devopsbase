  "readme": "# resource-tester cookbook\n\n# Requirements\nChef 10.16.2 or higher\n\n# Motivation\nWith the release of 10.16.0, the community quickly found a rather serious bug.\n(ticket CHEF-3547). The remote_file resource was not keeping it's\npromises. After talking with Josh, I learned that there are plans to\nexercise \"reference\" cookbooks during testing. I needed an excuse to learn minitest-chef, so I decided to\nstart the ultimate reference cookbook. It would exercise all the core Chef resources to make sure they\nkept their basic contracts.\n\nThis cookbook is meant to act as a source of examples for writing\ntests and cross platform design patterns.\n\nHopefully it will make it into the testing process.\n\n# Usage\n\ncd ~/src/resource-tester\nbundle exec kitchen test\n\n# Attributes\nn/a (yet). Add some!\n\n# Recipes\ndefault.rb is a monolithic recipe for now.\n\n# TODO\nTONS. This is just a start. Right now, only the user, file (+cousins), and cron types are exercised.\nIt only works on centos.\n\nMy time to work on this is close to non-existent, so its continued\ndevelopement needs to be a community effort. Send pull requests!\n\nThe short list:\n1) Add tests for packages and services\n2) Refactor to be cross platform across ubuntu\n3) Refactor again to work across all \"supported\" Chef platforms.\n4) Devise a strategy for testing \"through time\". This is needed to\ntest general idempotence, long running node behavior in the face of package updates and\nrepo modifications, multi-phase convergence problems (see pki cookbook), etc.\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: Sean OMeara (<someara@opscode.com>)\n",
