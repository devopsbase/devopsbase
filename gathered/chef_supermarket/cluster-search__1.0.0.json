  "readme": "Cluster Search\n==============\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nCluster Search (cluster-search) is a simple cookbook library which simplify\nthe search of members of a cluster. It relies on Chef search with a size guard\n(to avoid inconsistencies during initial convergence) and allows a fall-back\nto hostname listing if user does not want to rely on searches (because of\nchef-solo for example).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFirst, call `::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, ClusterSearch)` to be able to use\n`cluster_search` in your recipe.\n\nThen method `cluster_search` take one argument, a hash which could contain:\n\n- `role` and `size` to use search. Ex: `{ role: my_search, size: 2 }`\n- or `hosts` to use a static list. Ex: `{ hosts: [ some_node ] }`\n\nIf both are defined, `hosts` is used.\n\nIt returns the list of the members of a cluster `hosts` and current node ID\n`my_id` for this cluster (or -1 it is not a member).\n\nFor search, we suppose that all members of a cluster have a common role in\ntheir run-list. For instance, all zookeeper nodes of a dedicated cluster for\nkafka could use role *zookeeper-kafka*. By defining `role` to\n*zookeeper-kafka* and configuring `size` to the expected size of the cluster,\nwe can find all the cluster members.\n\nWe can find input/output examples (used for test cases) in file\n*.kitchen.yml*.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n### 1.0.0:\n\n- Initial version, tested with full kitchen suites\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nNone. Should work on any platform.\n\nLibraries\n---------\n\n### default\n\nImplements `cluster_search` method.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nRecipe used for testing.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nYou are more than welcome to submit issues and merge requests to this project.\n\n### Commits\n\nYour commits must pass `git log --check` and messages should be formated\nlike this (based on this excellent\n[post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):\n\n```\nSummarize change in 50 characters or less\n\nProvide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the\nsummary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.\n\nIf the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final\nparagraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format\nbelow.\n\nFix #42\n```\n\nAlso do your best to factor commits appropriately, ie not too large with\nunrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small\nchange applied N times in N different commits. If there was some accidental\nreformatting or whitespace changes during the course of your commits, please\nrebase them away before submitting the PR.\n\n### Files\n\nAll files must be 80 columns width formatted (actually 79), exception when it\nis not possible.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@s4m.io>)\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2015, Sam4Mobile\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n"
