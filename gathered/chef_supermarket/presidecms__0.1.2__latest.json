  "readme": "PresideCMS Cookbook\n===================\n\nThis cookbook installs PresideCMS on Railo 4.2 and Tomcat 7 (configurable). The result is a vanilla Tomcat + Railo server with the following modifications:\n\n* Tuckey URL Rewrite Filter is installed and configured for PresideCMS\n* PresideCMS is downloaded and a server wide Railo mapping is created\n* Railo is configured for PresideCMS (small tweaks to default configuration)\n\nRight now, no example site is installed. The intention of this Cookbook is simply a working server that is ready to have sites running under Tomcat.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe cookbook has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but should work on most platforms where Java 6 or 7 work.\n\n### Platforms\n- Ubuntu\n\n### Cookbooks\n- railo\n- zip\n\nAttributes\n----------\nversion\n\n* `node['presidecms']['version']` PresideCMS version, right now only 'bleedingedge' (default) and 'stable' are available\n* `node['presidecms']['installation_root_directory']` Root directory in which to install PresideCMS. Defaults to \"/opt/preside\" which result in the core CMS code being installed to \"/opt/preside/presidecms-x.x.x.xxx\" (where x.x.x.xxx is the version of PresideCMS that is installed.\n\nUsage\n-----\nJust include `recipe[presidecms]` in your node's `run_list`\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1.
