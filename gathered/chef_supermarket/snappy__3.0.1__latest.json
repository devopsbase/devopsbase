  "readme": "# snappy chef cookbook\n\nInstalls/Configures snappy, the compression codec from google\n\n## Overview\n\nA very basic recipe to install snappy from a downloaded tarball.\n\nNOTE: **Not needed for HBase / Flume / Hadoop** (those should use the native libs as provided by the hadoop_cluster cookbook)\n\nFrom [their documentation](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/):\n\n> Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum\n> compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it\n> aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared\n> to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most\n> inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100%\n> bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy\n> compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or\n> more.  Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable and\n> MapReduce to our internal RPC systems. (Snappy has previously been referred to\n> as \"Zippy\" in some presentations and the likes.)\n>\n> For more information, please see the README. Benchmarks against a few other\n> compression libraries (zlib, LZO, LZF, FastLZ, and QuickLZ) are included in\n> the source code distribution. The source code also contains a formal format\n> specification, as well as a specification for a framing format useful for\n> higher-level framing and encapsulation of Snappy data, e.g. for transporting\n> Snappy-compressed data across HTTP in a streaming fashion. Note that there is\n> currently no known code implementing the latter.\n>\n> Snappy is written in C++, but C bindings are included, and several bindings to\n> other languages are maintained by third parties\n\n## Recipes \n\n* `default`                  - Base configuration for snappy\n\n## Integration\n\nSupports platforms: debian and ubuntu\n\nCookbook dependencies:\n* install_from\n\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `[:snappy][:home_dir]`              - Installed location of snappy (default: \"/usr/local/share/snappy\")\n* `[:snappy][:release_url]`           - Snappy release tarball to install (default: \"http://snappy.googlecode.com/files/snappy-:version:.tar.gz\")\n* `[:snappy][:version]`               -  (default: \"1.0.4\")\n\n## License and Author\n\nAuthor::                Philip (flip) Kromer - Infochimps, Inc (<coders@infochimps.com>)\nCopyright::             2011, Philip (flip) Kromer - Infochimps, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n> readme generated by [cluster_chef](http://github.com/infochimps/cluster_chef)'s cookbook_munger\n",
