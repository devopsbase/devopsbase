  "readme": "# ssh-hardening (Chef cookbook)\n\n## Description\n\nThis cookbook provides secure ssh-client and ssh-server configurations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Opscode chef\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `['network']['ipv6']['enable']` - true if IPv6 is needed\n* `['ssh']['cbc_required']` - true if CBC for ciphers is required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure ciphers enabled. CBC is a weak alternative. Anything weaker should be avoided and is thus not available.\n* `['ssh']['weak_hmac']` - true if weaker HMAC mechanisms are required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure HMACs enabled. \n* `['ssh']['weak_kex']` - true if weaker Key-Exchange (KEX) mechanisms are required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure KEXs enabled.\n* `['ssh']['allow_root_with_key']` - `false` to disable root login altogether. Set to `true` to allow root to login via key-based mechanism.\n* `['ssh']['ports']` - ports to which ssh-server should listen to and ssh-client should connect to\n* `['ssh']['listen_to']` - one or more ip addresses, to which ssh-server should listen to. Default is empty, but should be configured for security reasons!\n* `['ssh']['remote_hosts']` - one or more hosts, to which ssh-client can connect to. Default is empty, but should be configured for security reasons!\n\n## Data Bags\n\nThis cookbook handles authorized keys for the root user. Use other cookbooks to set up your users.\n\nHave users in your `data_bag/users/` directory. This cookbook looks for users inside this folder with a `ssh_rootkey`.\n\nExample: \n\nFirst you have to find out the ssh-key of the user you want to allow. A typical example for this is\n\n    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIf that folder doesn't exist or you don't know what this is all about, please read a SSH tutorial for your blend of operating system first.\n\nYou can now add this key to the data bag. Example for dada:\n\nExample for `data_bags/users/dada.json`\n\n    {\n      \"id\" : \"dada\",\n      // ... other stuff ...\n      \"ssh_rootkey\" : \"ssh-rsa AAAA....mail.com\"\n    }\n\nYou can then access\n\n    ssh root@yourmachines\n\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the recipes to the run_list:\n    \n    \"recipe[ssh]\"\n\nThis will install ssh-server and ssh-client. You can alternatively choose only one via:\n\n    \"recipe[ssh::server]\"\n    \"recipe[ssh::client]\"\n\nConfigure attributes:\n\n    \"ssh\" : {\n      \"listen_to\" : \"10.2.3.4\"\n    }\n\nUnder `listen` you can define a number of accept-rules, comprised of at least the field `proto`, which designates one or more protocols/services. `to` and `from` may take one or more ip addresses (including bitmasks) upon which the rule will act.\n\n\n## Contributors + Kudos\n\n* Dominik Richter\n* Christoph Hartmann\n* Patrick Meier\n* Bernhard K. Weisshuhn\n\nThis cookbook is mostly based on guides by:\n\n* [NSA: Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/os/redhat/rhel5-pamphlet-i731.pdf)\n* [Deutsche Telekom, Group IT Security, Security Requirements (German)](http://www.telekom.com/static/-/155996/7/technische-sicherheitsanforderungen-si)\n\nThanks to all of you!!\n\n\n## License and Author\n\n* Author:: Dominik Richter <dominik.richter@googlemail.com>\n* Author:: Deutsche Telekom AG\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
