  "readme": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nDownloads netatalk source package and builds it with SSL support.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\nDebian/Ubuntu with netatalk 2+.\n\n= ATTRIBUTES:\n\nAttributes are in the \"netatalk\" attribute key.\n\n* shares - Array of shares, populates AppleVolumes.default, one line per entry. See the netatalk doc for the format of this file.\n* share_base - Base directory to share, default /srv/afp_share\n* share_base_owner - User that should own the share_base, default root.\n* share_base_group - Group that should own the share_base, default root.\n\n= USAGE:\n\nThe default netatalk package on Debian/Ubuntu does not have SSL support, so newer Mac OS X clients will be unable to authenticate.\n\nInclude the \"netatalk\" recipe on the desired node's run list. This recipe will include the \"netatalk::build_deb\" recipe, which downloads the source package and builds with SSL support. The build_deb recipe will install the build dependencies to use debuild to build the netatalk package. This does take quite some time to build.\n\nOnce the package is built, it will be installed with dpkg. The base share directory will be created as well, and the AppleVolumes.default share config file will be written.\n\nThe shares do need to be configured, and you can set up the attributes in a role, e.g. \"netatalk_server\" with default or override attributes:\n\n    \"netatalk\" => {\n      \"share_base\" => \"/srv/export\",\n      \"share_base_owner\" => \"jtimberman\",\n      \"share_base_group\" => \"jtimberman\",\n      \"shares\" => [\n        '~/ \"Home Directory\"',\n        '/srv/export/timemachine \"TimeMachine\" allow:jtimberman cnidscheme:cdb'\n      ]\n    }\n\n= LICENSE AND AUTHOR:\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman <joshua@opscode.com>\nCopyright 2009-2010, Opscode\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"
