  "readme": "ELLK Cookbook\n============\n\n[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)\n\nhack friendly: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Logstash-forwarder and Kibana\n\n*note: expects consumer to install java and handle certs*\n\nSupport and Tested\n------------\ncentos66\n\nRequirements\n------------\n- chef 11+\n- some kind of java\n- see [metadata](/metadata.rb) for complexity\n\nAbout\n------------\nThe mindset for this creation is that logstash-forwarder is pleasant enough\nto cast out to all your resident nodes and since messing with templates is a pain,\nit allows you to just provide a hash to template out the configuration.  Making\nrecipes easier to configure with.\n\nNext in the chain are the `logstash` nodes.  Typically, I'd imagine them to be 1:1 with all\n`elasticsearch` nodes also created by this LWRP; so `localhost` is a default output.  Otherwise,\nthe matra of this design is if defaults don't work, `source` your consuming cookbook with your own\ntemplates copied from this cookbook.  Pass any optional config vars you want in your templaes with \n`conf_options` attribute and hack away.\n\nThis is hack friendly and mainly focused on getting you a framework\nto work by.  The heavy lifting comes from ARK and RUNIT cookbooks; everything else is template \nmanipulation.  Any discovery trickeness should be handled at the consuming recipe.\n\nSee [ellktest](/test/cookbooks/ellktest/recipes/default.rb) as an example.\n\nContributing\n------------\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write your change\n4. Write tests for your change (if applicable)\n5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n6.
