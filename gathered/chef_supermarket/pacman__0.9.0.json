  "readme": "DESCRIPTION\n===========\n\nRefreshes the pacman package cache from the FTP servers and provides an LWRP for managing package groups.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n\nPlatform: ArchLinux. Pacman is not relevant on other platforms.\n\nUSAGE\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[pacman]` early in the run list, preferably first, to ensure that the package caches are updated before trying to install new packages.\n\nUse the `pacman_group` resource to install or remove pacman package groups. Note that at this time the LWRP will check if the group is installed but doesn't do a lot of error checking or handling. File a ticket on the COOK project at tickets.opscode.com for improvements and feature requests.\n\nLICENSE AND AUTHOR\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright:: Opscode, Inc.
