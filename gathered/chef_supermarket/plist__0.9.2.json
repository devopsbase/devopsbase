To select keys for\nmodification, the LWRP depends on the Nokogiri gem's CSS3 query feature. The user can then modify the selected keys like\nthey would XML nodes in the DOM tree, and the result is written back to the user- or system-level plist.\n\n### License\n\n    Copyright 2014 Roy Liu\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not\n    use this file except in compliance with the License.
