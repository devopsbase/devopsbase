  "readme": "# chef-logentries\n\n## Description\n\nInstalls the [Logentries](http://logentries.com) [Agent](http://logentries.com/doc/agent/), and provides definitions to manage registering servers and following logs.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe following platforms are supported by this cookbook, meaning that the recipes run on these platforms without error:\n\n* Ubuntu\n\n## Recipes\n\n* `logentries` - Set up the apt repository and install the logentries package\n\n## Usage\n\nThis cookbook installs the Logentries Agent package from the Logentries apt repository.\n\nAdditionally this cookbook provides a `logentries` definition which you can use to register hosts, follow logs, and execute other `le` based commands.\n\n```ruby\n# register a server\nlogentries do\n  account_key 'abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz123456'\n  server_name 'appserver'\n\n  action :register\nend\n\n# follow a log (if it hasn't already been logged)\nlogentries '/var/log/syslog' do\n  log_name 'Syslog'\n  action :follow\nend\n```\n\nYou can use logentries from a json node config too by specifying a logentries element in your config with an `account_key`, `server_name`, and optionally some `log_files`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"logentries\": {\n    \"account_key\": \"abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz123456\",\n    \"server_name\": \"My Server\",\n    \"log_files\": {\n      \"App Server\": \"/var/www/myapp/log/production.log\",\n      \"Syslog\": \"/var/log/syslog\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nLogentries is split into two packages, `logentries` and `logentries-daemon`, the former contains the command-line tools and the latter is the reporting agent. Unfortunately, when you install the `logentries-daemon` package it immediately tries to start the agent and will fail if you haven't pre-configured your host settings; this is problematic in a Chef script, because we haven't had an opportunity to set things up yet.\n\nTo solve this problem, the commandline tools are installed immediately, then the `logentries-daemon` package will only be installed at the end of your chef run; it will be triggered by the use of any of the `logentries` definitions.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5.
