  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls and configures SNORT. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the packages\nfrom apt are used. On RHEL and Fedora systems, the packages are\nretrieved directly from the SNORT project site.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n## Platform\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04\n* RHEL/CentOS, 6.0 and higher only.\n* Fedora 17\n\nMay work on other platforms in the Debian and RHEL families with or\nwithout modification.\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nNo other cookbooks are dependencies, however to use one of the\ndatabase backends, the appropriate cookbook should be used. For\nexample, Opscode cookbooks:\n\n* mysql\n* postgresql\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nSee `attributes/default.rb` for default values.\n\n* `node['snort']['home_net']` - Address range to use for preseeding\n  `HOME_NET`.\n* `node['snort']['database']` - The database backend to use. Only\n  applicable on Debian/Ubuntu systems. Default none. MySQL and\n  PostgreSQL are usable. The default recipe will install the SNORT\n  package for the appropriate database backend. You'll need to make\n  sure that the database server is set up in some way such that SNORT\n  can connect to it. This cookbook does not yet support automatic\n  configuration.\n* `node['snort']['rpm']['daq_version']` - The full version string of\n  the daq package to install, e.g. \"`2.0.0-1.fc17`\".\n* `node['snort']['rpm']['daq_checksum']` - The SHA256 checksum of the\n  daq rpm.\n* `node['snort']['rpm']['version']` - The full version string of the\n  snort package to install, e.g., \"`2.9.4-1.f17`\".\n* `node['snort']['rpm']['checksum']` - The SHA256 checksum of the\n  snort rpm.\n\n**NOTE** Upstream, the SNORT project has deprecated the database\n  output\n  [as of version 2.9.3](http://blog.snort.org/2012/07/database-output-is-dead-rip.html).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[snort]` in a run list to have the system get SNORT\ninstalled. This performs a baseline installation and preseeds the\npackage. You should change the `node['snort']['home_net']` attribute\nto the appropriate network.\n\nWe recommend adding a `template` resource to the default recipe to\nmanage the `/etc/snort/snort.conf` file as a template. The default\nfile is good enough for now on Debian/Ubuntu.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian, the default rules package will be installed. You'll\nneed to download and install additional rules. Automatically updating\nrules with oinkmaster is not yet supported. See future plans.\n\nFuture Plans\n============\n\nThe following features are planned for a future release of this\ncookbook. Contributions welcome, see\n[How to Contribute](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute)\n\nPerform additional configuration of `/etc/snort/snort.conf` via\ntemplate.\n\nOinkmaster automatic rules updates.\n\nSource-based installation.\n\nOther platforms in general :).\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n* [SNORT home page](http://www.snort.org)\n* [snort -h doesn't do what you think](http://blog.joelesler.net/2010/03/snort-h-doesnt-do-what-you-think-it-does.html)\n* [SNORT database output is dead](http://blog.snort.org/2012/07/database-output-is-dead-rip.html)\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n- Author: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n- Copyright 2010-2012, Opscode, Inc (<legal@opscode.com>)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
