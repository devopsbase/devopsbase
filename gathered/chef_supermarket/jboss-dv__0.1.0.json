  "readme": "#jboss-dv\n\nThis cookbook installs JBoss Data Virtualization (DV) in existing JBoss EAP installation. EAP installation is not part of this cookbook. It must be installed before by using [jboss-eap](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/jboss-eap) cookbook.\n\nAs JBoss DV installer is given by Red Hat only as izPack installer, the cookbook uses silent mode of izPack to do the install.\n\n\n##Requirements\n\n###Platforms\n\nThis has only be tested on:\n\n* RHES 5\n* CentOS 6\n\n###Cookbook\n\n* Java is not managed.

It is a dependency and some of its attributes are used by jboss-dv.\n* JBoss DV installer jar file must be downloaded from JBoss DV website, with JBoss developer account.\n\n##Attributes\n\nFollowing [jboss-eap](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/jboss-eap) attributes are used:\n\n* `node['jboss-eap']['jboss_home']` - Home directory of JBoss EAP. Default value is set by jboss-eap cookbook to `#{node['jboss-eap']['install_path']}/#{node['jboss-eap']['symlink']}`\n* `node['jboss-eap']['admin_passwd']` - Can be used for `node['jboss-dv']['master_passwd']`attribute. See explanation below.\n\nFollowing attributes are only for JBoss DV:\n\n* `node['jboss-dv']['version']` - DV version to install. Default value is `6.2.0.redhat-3`.\n* `node['jboss-dv']['package_url']` - URL to get JBoss DV installer. Default value is `http://example.com/jboss-dv-installer-#{node['jboss-dv']['version']}.jar'\n`\n* `node['jboss-dv']['checksum']` - sha256sum of package_url file\n* `node['jboss-dv']['master_passwd']` - Master password of JBoss DV. Value has to be >= 8 characters, with one numeric, one special character.
