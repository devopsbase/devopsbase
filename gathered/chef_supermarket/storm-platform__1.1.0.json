  "readme": "Storm Cluster\n=================\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n[Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) is a free and open source distributed\nrealtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded\nstreams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch\nprocessing. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is\na lot of fun to use!\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Easy Setup\n\nThis cookbook creates the number of nodes specified by attribute\n`node['storm-platform']['size']` (3 by default). The first node to be created\nwill be setup with a Nimbus, a LogViewer and a UI. All other nodes will host a\nSupervisor and a LogViewer. To get this cookbook to setup the nth node to hold\nthe Nimbus, Supervisor and LogViewer instead of the first one, change attribute\n`node['storm-platform']['nimbus_id']`.\n\nBy default, this cookbook installs *openjdk* from the official repositories\n*(openjdk 8 on centos 7)* just before starting the service. You can change\nthis behavior by setting `node['storm-platform']['java']` to `\"\"`, or choose\nyour package by setting the package name in\n`node['storm-platform']['java'][node[:platform]]`.\n\nSee [roles](test/integration/roles) for some examples and *Cluster Search*\ndocumentation for more information.\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is fully tested through the installation of the full platform\nin docker hosts. This uses kitchen, docker and some monkey-patching.\n\nIf you run `kitchen list`, you will see 4 suites:\n\n- dnsdock-centos-7\n- zookeeper-centos-7\n- storm-nimbus-centos-7\n- storm-supervisor-centos-7\n\nEach corresponds to a different node in the cluster.\n\nFor more information, see [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml) and [test](test)\ndirectory.\n\n### Local cluster\n\nThe cluster installed with `kitchen converge` is fully working and can thus be\nused as a local cluster for developments tests.\n\nOne can access the cluster by adding the dnsdock used in the cluster as main\nDNS resolver: add\n`docker inspect --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' dnsdock-storm`\nin `/etc/resolv.conf`.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n### 1.1.0\n\n- Strengthen tests reliability by sleeping after a Storm service is launch\n- Dependencies use supermarket, switch to zookeeper-platform\n\n### 1.0.1\n\n- Cleaning, use java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless as default java package\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n- Initial version with Centos 7 support\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb).\n\n### Gems\n\nDeclared in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\nA *systemd* managed distribution:\n- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos\n\nNote: it should work fine on Debian 8 but the official docker image does not\nallow systemd to work easily, so it could not be tested.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nInstalls a three node cluster as follow :\n\n* Nimbus + LogViewer + UI\n* Supervisor + LogViewer\n* Supervisor + LogViewer\n\n### install\n\nExtract a Storm tarball as per attributes.\n\n### create-user\n\nCreate system user for Storm binaries to run with.\n\n### config\n\nApply settings from attribute configuration to Storm configuration.\n\n### systemd-services\n\nCreate Systemd service files and set them up.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n\nNone.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nYou are more than welcome to submit issues and merge requests to this project.\nNote however that this cookbook will probably not support another supervisor\nthan *systemd*.\n\n### Commits\n\nYour commits must pass `git log --check` and messages should be formated\nlike this (based on this excellent\n[post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):\n\n```\nSummarize change in 50 characters or less\n\nProvide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the\nsummary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.\n\nIf the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final\nparagraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format\nbelow.\n\nFix #42\n```\n\nAlso do your best to factor commits appropriately, ie not too large with\nunrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small\nchange applied N times in N different commits. If there was some accidental\nreformatting or whitespace changes during the course of your commits, please\nrebase them away before submitting the PR.\n\n### Files\n\nAll files must be 80 columns width formatted (actually 79), exception when it\nis not possible.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Guillaume Alaux (<guillaume.alaux@s4m.io>)\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@s4m.io>)\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2015, Sam4Mobile\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
