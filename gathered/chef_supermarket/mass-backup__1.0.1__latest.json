  "readme": "mass-backup Cookbook\n====================\nmass-backup cookbook is the extension over Tartarus and covers the installation of scheduled database (PostgreSQL currently) and filesystem backups.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n#### packages\nsee metadata.rb\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n#### mass-backup::default\n\nTartarus configuration is required in order to successfully run the recipe.\n\nhttps://github.com/ffuenf/chef-tartarus\n\nUsage\n-----\n#### mass-backup::default\nJust include `mass-backup` in your node's `run_list`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":\"my_node\",\n  \"run_list\": [\n    \"recipe[mass-backup]\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIt installs required bash scripts that are responsible for the backup:\n- DB backup script - goes through users in the /home, and searches for \"backup\" directory where <name>_dump.conf files are executed in order to back up PostgreSQL. The configuration can be created with dedicated resource \"mass_backup_db_backup\"\n  - log file is written to /var/log/backup-db.log\n- Filesystem backup script - goes through defined tartarus backup configurations\n  - log file is written to /var/log/backup-fs.log\n\nResource\n-----\n\n#### mass_backup_db_backup\n\nExample resource usage:\n\n```ruby\nmass_backup_db_backup \"myuser\" do\n  group \"mygroup\"\n  databases(\n    \"mydb\" => {\n      \"vacuum\" => \"true\"\n    }\n  )\nend\n```\n\nCreates backup configuration in /home/myuser/backup/mydb_dump.conf. The resulting dump is taken by FS backup and transfer using Tartarus to the configured location.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1.
