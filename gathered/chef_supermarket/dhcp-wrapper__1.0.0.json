  "readme": "DHCP Wrapper\n============\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nInstall and configure [**ISC DHCP**](https://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/) by\nwrapping cookbook [**dhcp**][dhcp].\n\nCan also configure network interfaces by the use of cookbook\n[**network_interfaces_v2**][ni], for instance to\nset a static address at the server and dhcp for the clients.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Easy Setup\n\nAdd `recipe[dhcp-wrapper::server]` in your run-list to install and configure\n**DHCPD**. Configuration will be fetched from attributes `node['dhcp']`. See\ncookbook [**dhcp**][dhcp] documentation\nfor more information.\n\nAdd `recipe[dhcp-wrapper::client]` to install a dhcp client.\n\nAdd `recipe[dhcp-wrapper::network-interface]` to configure your network\ninterfaces. Configuration is fetched from attributes\n`node['dhcp-wrapper']['network-interface']` which should match those of\nprovider [**network_interface**][ni].\n\nTo see an example, look at [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml).\n\n### Test\n\nThis cookbook is fully tested through the installation of a server and a node\nin docker hosts. This uses kitchen, docker and some monkey-patching.\n\nIf you run kitchen list, you will see 2 suites, Each corresponds to a different\nserver:\n\n- server-centos-7: DHCPD server listening on eth1\n- node-centos-7: generic node with eth1 configured in dhcp\n\nFor more information, see [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml) and [test](test)\ndirectory.\n\nNote: This configuration need a second interface which is provided by\n[**pipework**](https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework). Because **pipework** need\nadministrative priviledges, sudo access is required to create the dockers\nwith `kitchen create`.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n### 1.0.0:\n\n- Initial version with Centos 7 support\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks\n\nDeclared in [metadata.rb](metadata.rb).\n\n### Gems\n\nDeclared in [Gemfile](Gemfile).\n\n### Platforms\n\n- RHEL Family 7, tested on Centos\n\nNote: it should work fine on Debian 8 but the official docker image does not\nallow systemd to work easily, so it could not be tested.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\nConfiguration is done by overriding default attributes. All configuration keys\nhave a default defined in [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb).\nPlease read it to have a comprehensive view of what and how you can configure\nthis cookbook behavior.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nDo nothing.\n\n### client\n\nInstall **dhclient** package.\n\n### server\n\nProxy for **dhcp::server** recipe. Please look at [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml)\nand [**dhcp**][dhcp] documentation for more information.\n\n### network-interface\n\nCall **network_interface_rhel** provider based on\nattributes `node['dhcp-wrapper']['network-interface']`.\nSee [.kitchen.yml](.kitchen.yml) and cookbook\n[**network_interface_v2**][ni] for more information.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n\nNone.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nYou are more than welcome to submit issues and merge requests to this project.\n\n### Commits\n\nYour commits must pass `git log --check` and messages should be formated\nlike this (based on this excellent\n[post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):\n\n```\nSummarize change in 50 characters or less\n\nProvide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the\nsummary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.\n\nIf the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final\nparagraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format\nbelow.\n\nFix #42\n```\n\nAlso do your best to factor commits appropriately, ie not too large with\nunrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small\nchange applied N times in N different commits. If there was some accidental\nreformatting or whitespace changes during the course of your commits, please\nrebase them away before submitting the MR.\n\n### Files\n\nAll files must be 80 columns width formatted (actually 79), exception when it\nis not possible.\n\nLicense and Author\n------------------\n\n- Author:: Samuel Bernard (<samuel.bernard@s4m.io>)\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2015, Sam4Mobile\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n[dhcp]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/dhcp\n[ni]: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/network_interfaces_v2\n",
