  "readme": "Description\n===========\nInstalls Twitter's Storm distributed computation platform.  Includes recipes for installing\nboth the Nimbus / Web UI component and the Supervisor component.\n\nRequirements\n============\n* Ubuntu 10.04 / 12.04\n* May function on other distributions, but has not been tested\n\n* java cookbook\n* runit cookbook\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis recipe relies on two setup components that need to be noted as they are not used\nin many (or any) community cookbooks.\n\nRole Based Cluster Setup:\nThis cookbook relies on a cluster identification role to allow more than one storm cluster\nto run in a single Chef environment, while not breaking Chef search.  Create a role with\na name of your choosing.  The role may be left empty or you may use it to apply the your\napplication's topology and all necessary JARs within your topology.  You will need to\nspecify the name of this role using the node attribute ['storm']['cluster_role'], which\nis empty by default.  You will need to apply this cluster role to both supervisor and\nthe nimbus/UI node in your cluster\n\nDeploy Flag:\nThis cookbook uses a deploy flag to prevent the application from deploying unless desired\nand allows for an undeploy recipe to run prior to the deploy.  The deploy recipe will also\ncleanup the state of storm and is sufficient to wipe clean any topology deploy, although\nit does not stop the actual topology (that's in the works).  Once you've applied the\nsupervisor or nimbus recipes to a node you need to have \"deploy_build=true\" set in your\nshell.  \"sudo deploy_build=true chef-client\" can be used to set the environment variable\nand run Chef in a single command.",
