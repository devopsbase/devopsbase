  "readme": "TeamForge-Chef Integration Cookbook\n===================================\n\nInstalls scripts and associated automation needed to get CollabNet TeamForge and Chef integrated.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nCollabNet TeamForge Server plus some nodes to deploy software to.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nSee `attributes/default.rb` for default values.\n\nchefauth\n--------\n\n* `node['tfchefint']['chefauth']['sf-admin-home']` - the default install location of CollabNet TeamForge and hence the home directory of the 'sf-admin' user\n* `node['tfchefint']['chefauth']['chef-server-url']` - the Chef server to contact in the asynchronous callback scripts\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nDoes nothing.\n\nclient\n------\n\nConvenient recipe that includes `user` and `sudoers` recipes to make the integration work. 'client' runs on each application server;\n\nserver\n------\n\nConvenient recipe that includes relevant individual recipes to make the integration work. 'server' runs on the TeamForge server itself and installs the asynchronous hook and authentication components (e.g. Chef configurations)\n\nartifact_update_hook\n--------------------\n\nInstalls the artifact update hook script, which is a template, into the asynchronous hooks directory.\n\nchefauth\n--------\n\nSets up the TeamForge server so that Knife, running under the 'sf-admin' (TeamForge) user ID, can authenticate to the Chef server as a client.\n\nWe assume that a user called 'sf-admin' has been created ahead of time on the Chef server, and that the 'sf-admin.pem' can be placed manually on the TeamForge server.\n\nhooks\n-----\n\nInstalls the Java-to-arbitrary-language bridge, `hooks.jar`, on the TeamForge server, so that the artifact_update Ruby script can run.\n\nWhile `hooks.jar` is not officially supported by CollabNet, some directions on its design can be found on CollabNet's blog: http://blogs.collab.net/teamforge/custom-workflow-in-teamforge-a-guide-to-iaf-event-handlers\n\nA version of `hooks.jar` that supports passing flex field data as environment variables is included. It was retrieved from here: http://forums.open.collab.net/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=738&dsMessageId=486169\n\nsudoers\n-------\n\nSets up sudoers on client machines so that the 'sf-admin' user can run Chef client as root (or signal the currently-running daemon to restart).\n\nNote: The sf-admin user needs to be able to run the commands in this recipe without requiring a TTY. You can set this up in your main sudoers file if necessary (e.g. using Opscode's sudo cookbook), or if you're running OpenSSH >= 5.9, the `RequestTTY` option can be used in the host's ssh_options to always force the creation of a TTY.\n\nuser\n----\n\nSets up a user called `sf-admin` on client machines.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n* Authors:: Julian C.
