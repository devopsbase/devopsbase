  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nProvides an LWRP to declare that a directory's contents are entirely\nmanaged by Chef.  When a node is converged, any files present in the\n`managed_directory` that are not managed by Chef will be removed.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\nKnown to work on CentOS and OS X.  Should work on other Unix-like\nsystems.\n\n\nResource/Provider\n=================\n\n`managed_directory`\n---------------------------\n\nEnsure that a directory contains only files put there by Chef in this\nrun.  Any other files will be removed.\n\n### Actions\n\n- `:clean` - Remove any unmanaged files.\n\n### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `path` - (name attribute) The absolute path to the directory to be managed.\n- `clean_files` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged files should be\n  removed. Default is `true`.\n- `clean_links` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged links should be\n  removed. Default is `true`.\n- `clean_directories` - Boolean to determine whether unmanaged subdirectories\n  should be removed. Default is `false`.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nInclude the default recipe in a run list to make the resource\navailable in your run.\n\ntest\n----\n\nThe 'test' recipe illustrates use of the `managed_directory` resource.\n\ntest_directories\n----------------\n\nThe 'test_directories' recipe illustrates use of the `managed_directory`\nresource when having it clean up unwanted subdirectories.\n\n\nCaveats\n=======\n\n * The directory to be managed must already exist.  If you also need\n   to ensure that the directory exists, use the Directory resource\n   separately.\n\n * If you require subdirectories to be managed as well, be sure to set the\n   `clean_directories` attribute to `true`\n\n * A file is considered to be managed if there is a resource with a\n   name attribute equal to the file's full path.  It will do the wrong\n   thing if this assumption is not true for the contents of your\n   directory.\n\n * Files managed by resources created after this LWRP is converged\n   (eg, from within a `ruby_block` or LWRP later in the run list) will\n   be incorrectly identified as \"unmanaged\", and then deleted.  They\n   will be recreated later in the run, but this creates a window where\n   the file is missing.\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthors:\n- Zachary Stevens ([zts](https://github.com/zts))\n- Gregory Ruiz-Ade ([gkra](https://github.com/gkra))\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"
