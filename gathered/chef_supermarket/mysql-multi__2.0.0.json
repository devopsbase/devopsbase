This wrapper\nshould work on all Debian and RHEL platform family OS's.\n\nUtilization\n------------\n\nThis cookbook provides libraries to work along with MySQL community cookbook to\nallow for the creation of master/slave and master/multi-slave MySQL systems.\n\nThe recipes and libraries provided here are designed for clean initial server setups of\nthis type of systems. They are not designed to do any type of fail-over, this type\nof automation is better addressed by other tools.\n\n*** Special Note:\nThis cookbook only supports MySQL community cookbook version 6.x, major changes\nin this cookbook prior to version 6 have caused it to not be backwards compatible.\nIf you need support for MySQL community cookbook 5.x then use version 1.4.2 of\nthis cookbook.\n\nThis cookbook provides two recipes depending on the server's role. Keep in mind this\ncookbook as well as the community MySQL cookbook have gone to a pure library design.\nThese recipes are provided for backwards compatibility and as examples of how to\nwrite wrapper recipes to utilize the libraries. They may be removed in later releases.\n\n`mysql_master.rb` : sets up a master MySQL server and creates replicant users\nfor each slave node definded within attributes.\n\nWhen utilized, search will look for the node(s) in the same environment with the tag\n`mysql_slave` and grant the allowed replicating node(s). If you do not want to\nuse search, create the slave node(s) first before bootstrapping, and set the\nattribute `['mysql-multi']['master']` with the correct IP array.\n\n`mysql_slave.rb` : sets up a slave MySQL server pointing to the master node\ndefinded within attributes.\n\nSearch will look for the node in the same environment with the tag\n`mysql_master` and set master replication to that node. If you do not want to\nuse search, create the master node first before bootstrapping, and set the\nattribute `['mysql-multi']['master']` with the correct IP.\n\nNote that once a master has been discovered, it will no longer be automatically\nchanged to new masters as they are deployed. If a new master is installed, or\nthe existing master is deleted, you must manually set a new master for existing\nslaves by editing the `['mysql-multi']['master']` attribute as described below.\n\nAttributes\n-----------\n\n`['mysql-multi']['master']` : sets the IP address that defines the master node\n\n`['mysql-multi']['slaves']` : is any array that defines the IP address(es) of\nthe slave node(s).\n\n`['mysql-multi']['slave_user']` : allows for the setting of a custom name for\nthe slave MySQL user, by default it is set to 'replicant'.\n\n`['mysql-multi']['server_repl_password']` : sets password for replicant user\n\n`['mysql-multi']['bind_ip']` is an override for the logic that determines the\nbest `bind_address` for mysql. Allowing you to set it to whatever is needed for\nyour specific configuration.\n\nAdditional attributes added due to the redesign of the community MySQL recipe.\n\n`['mysql-multi']['server_root_password']` sets root password for MySQL service.\n\n`['mysql-multi']['service_name']` sets name for mysql service used in MySQL community recipe. Default is set to 'chef'\n\n`['mysql-multi']['server_version']` sets version of mysql installed via MySQL community cookbook. Defaults to 5.5.\n\n`['mysql-multi']['bind_address'] ` sets listening bind_address to 0.0.0.0 by default\n\n`['mysql-multi']['service_port']` sets listening port for MySQL service. Default to 3306.\n\nNotice on need for mysql2 gem\n-------------------------------\n\nThe libraries (specifically slave_grants and slave_sync) require the mysql2 gem to be\ninstalled on the nodes. This is currently done within the slave/master sample recipes. If\nyou are calling these libraries directly you need to ensure you are addressing this\nrequirement.\n\nIt can be addresses by adding the cookbook `mysql2_chef_gem' to your depends lists\nas well as adding this code to your recipe:\n\n```ruby\n\nmysql2_chef_gem 'default' do\n  action :install\nend\n\n```\n\nCustom my.cnf settings\n------------------------\n\nCurrently the community MySQL cookbook does not address the need to add custom my.cnf configuration options to the default my.cnf file.\n\nIt simply drops the default my.cnf provided by the OS. You are expected to write a custom my.cnf file and add it to the /etc/mysql-service/conf.d/ directory if needed.\n\nThis can be done using the mysql_config resource, below is an example of what that might look like:\n\n```ruby\n\nmysql_config 'custom my.cnf stuff' do\n  config_name 'custom.my.cnf'\n  instance 'default'\n  source 'custom.my.cnf.erb'\n  variables(:foo => 'bar')\n  action :create\n  notifies :restart, 'mysql_service[default]'\nend\n\n```\n\nFor additional documentation and examples see [MySQL community README] (https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mysql)\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Christopher Coffey (<christopher.coffey@rackspace.com>)\n- Author:: Brint O'Hearn (<brint.ohearn@rackspace.com>)\n- Author:: BK Box (<bk@theboxes.org>)\n\n```text\n\nCopyright:: 2014-2015 Rackspace US, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
