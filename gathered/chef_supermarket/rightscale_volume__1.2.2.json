Additional resources need to be created in\nthe recipe to manage the attached volume as a filesystem or logical volume.\n\nThe following example will create a 10 GB volume, attach it to the instance, formats the device as ext4\nand mounts it to '/mnt/storage'.\n\n```ruby\n# Creates a 10 GB volume\nrightscale_volume \"db_data_volume\" do\n  size 10\n  action :create\nend\n\n# Attaches the volume to the instance\nrightscale_volume \"db_data_volume\" do\n  action :attach\nend\n\nexecute \"format volume as ext4\" do\n  command lazy { \"mkfs.ext4 #{node['rightscale_volume']['db_data_volume']['device']}\" }\n  action :run\nend\n\nexecute \"mount volume to /mnt/storage\" do\n  command lazy { \"mkdir -p /mnt/storage; mount #{node['rightscale_volume']['db_data_volume']['device']} /mnt/storage\" }\n  action :run\nend\n```\n\nThe following example will create a new volume from a snapshot.\n\n```ruby\nrightscale_volume \"db_data_volume_from_snapshot\" do\n  size 10\n  snapshot_id \"my-snaphot-id\"\n  action [ :create, :attach ]\nend\n```\n\nThe `size` may or may not be honored depending on hypervisor used by the cloud vendor.\nIf the cloud does not support resize when creating a volume from a snapshot, then the size will be\nthe same as the volume from which the snapshot was taken. If resize is supported, additional\nresources will be required to resize the filesystem on the volume.\n\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\nThe default recipe installs the `right_api_client` RubyGem, which this cookbook requires in\norder to work with the RightScale API.\n\n\n# Resource/Providers\n\n## rightscale_volume\n\nA resource to create, attach, and manage a single \"volume\" on public and private IaaS clouds.\n\n### Actions\n\n| Name | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `:create` | Creates a new volume in the cloud | yes |\n| `:attach` | Attaches a volume to a RightScale server | |\n| `:snapshot` | Takes a snapshot of a volume | |\n| `:detach` | Detaches a volume from a RightScale server | |\n| `:delete` | Deletes a volume from the cloud | |\n| `:cleanup` | Cleans up old snapshots of a volume | |\n\n### Attributes\n\n| Name | Description | Default | Required |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `nickname` | Name of the volume to be created | | No |\n| `size` | Volume size in gigabytes | `1` | No |\n| `description` | Description for the volume | | No |\n| `snapshot_id` | Snapshot ID to create the volume from | | No |\n| `options` | Optional parameters hash for volume creation. For example, `:volume_type` on Rackspace Open Clouds and `:iops` on AWS clouds | `{}` | No |\n| `timeout` | Throws an error if an action could not be completed within this timeout (in minutes) | `15` | No |\n| `max_snapshots` | The number of snapshots of a volume to retain when running the `:cleanup` action | `60` | No |\n\n\n# Cloud Specific Notes\n\n## AWS EC2\n\n* For this resource to work on a EC2 cloud, the RightScale account must be on a\n  [UCP](http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Dashboard_Users_Guide/Unified_Cloud_Platform) cluster.\n* This cloud supports creating volumes with provisioned IOPS. To create a volume with IOPS on EC2\n  pass the `:iops` option to the `options` hash as shown below\n\n```ruby\nrightscale_volume \"volume_with_iops\" do\n  size 10\n  options {:iops => 100}\n  action :create\nend\n```\n\n## Rackspace Open Cloud\n\n* The minimum volume size offered by this cloud is 100 GB. The `:create` volume action throws an\n  error if the requested volume size is lesser than the minimum size offered.\n* This cloud supports two types of volume - SATA and SSD. The type of volume to be created can be\n  passed to the `options` parameter as below (defaults to SATA if none specified)\n\n```ruby\nrightscale_volume \"open_cloud_volume\" do\n  size 100\n  options {:volume_type => 'SSD'}\n  action :create\nend\n```\n* A volume cannot be deleted from this cloud if at least one snapshot created from this volume\n  exists. To delete such a volume, all dependent snapshots must be cleaned up first. The `:delete`\n  action does not delete such a volume and throws a warning message in the logs.\n\n## CloudStack Clouds\n\n* CloudStack has the concept of a \"custom\" disk offering. If a \"custom volume type\" is supported in the cloud,\n  then the `:create` action creates a volume with the requested size. If \"custom volume type\" is not supported\n  then this action will use the \"closest volume type\" with size greater than or equal to the requested size.\n  If there are multiple custom volume types or multiple volume types with the closest size, the one with the greatest\n  resource UID will be used.\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: RightScale, Inc.
