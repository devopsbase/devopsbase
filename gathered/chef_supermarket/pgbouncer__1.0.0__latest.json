It has example configuration for integration on client machines,\nexposing a local *nix socket that routes to a downstream database on another host.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nChef 0.7+\n\nPlatform\n--------\nTested:\n* Ubuntu\n\nUntested:\n* Debian (should work)\n* RHEL, Centos, etc\n\nDependencies\n---------\n\n'apt' cookbook\n\nResources/Providers\n===================\n\nThis cookbook exposes a single resource/provider pair, referred as `pgbouncer_connection`.  A basic \nexample of its use can be found in `recipes/example.rb`, and is outlined below.\n\n`pgbouncer_connection`\n----------------------\n\nSets up an Upstart service for pgbouncer against a single database alias, then starts the service.\nMultiple aliases may be supported on a single host.\n\n### Actions\n- :setup: configure a pgbouncer service for the specified database alias (default action)\n- :start: start the configured pgbouncer service\n- :stop: stop the configured pgbouncer service\n- :teardown: delete the configuration (FIXME: may not be comprehensive)\n\n### Examples\n    # setup and start a read-only connection pool\n    pgbouncer_connection \"database_example_com_ro\" do\n      db_host \"database.example.com\"\n      db_port \"6432\"\n      db_name \"test_database\"\n      userlist \"readonly_user\" => \"md500000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      max_client_conn 100\n      default_pool_size 20\n      action [:setup, :start]\n    end\n\n    # setup and start a read-write connection pool\n    pgbouncer_connection \"database_example_com_rw\" do\n      db_host \"database.example.com\"\n      db_port \"6432\"\n      db_name \"test_database\"\n      userlist \"readwrite_user\" => \"md500000000000000000000000000000000\", \"readonly_user\" => \"md500000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      max_client_conn 100\n      default_pool_size 20\n      action [:setup, :start]\n    end\n\n    # stop a connection pool\n    pgbouncer_connection \"database_example_com_ro\" do\n      action :stop\n    end\n\n    # TODO: include more examples\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nEmpty: this is a resource-only cookbook\n\nexample\n-------\n\nExample of how to use the resource; also exercised in the spec/ tests\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis cookbook has been \"Tested in Production\"&trade;, but also has some basic RSpec tests.\n\n**NOTE**: because Chef 10 has cookbook naming expectations, the root repo expects to be in a folder\nnamed 'pgbouncer'.\n\n      bundle install\n      bundle exec rake spec\n\nThe cookbook is clean under FoodCritic.\n\n      bundle install\n      bundle exec rake foodcritic\n\nTo see the installation end to end, we've also got a rake task that spins up a [chef-zero](https://github.com/jkeiser/chef-zero)\nlocal instance, uploads the cookbooks via berkshelf, and spins up a vagrant instance that pulls the data down.  This is using a new\nVagrant plugin, created here at Whitepages, called [vagrant-chefzero](https://github.com/whitepages/vagrant-chefzero/).\n\n      vagrant plugin install vagrant-chefzero\n      bundle install\n      bundle exec rake vagrant_startup\n\nLicense and Author(s)\n=====================\n\n- Author:: Owyn Richen (<orichen@whitepages.com>)\n- Author:: Jack Foy (<jfoy@whitepages.com>)\n- Author:: Paul Kohan (<pkohan@whitepages.com>)\n- Author:: Brian Engelman (<bengelman@whitepages.com>)\n\nCopyright 2010-2013, [Whitepages Inc.](http://www.whitepages.com/)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
