  "readme": "# Description\n\nInstalls the OpenOffice productivity suite.\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Chef\n\nTested on 0.10.2 and 0.10.4 but newer and older version should work just fine.\nFile an [issue][issues] if this isn't the case.\n\n## Platform\n\nThe following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the\nrecipes run on these platforms without error:\n\n* ubuntu\n\nPlease [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nThis cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:\n\n* [java][java_cb] (Opscode)\n\n# Installation\n\nDepending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install\nthis cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release\nis the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid\nChef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.\n\n## From the Opscode Community Platform\n\nTo install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:\n\n    knife cookbook site install openoffice\n\n## Using Librarian\n\nThe [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.\nInclude a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run\n`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:\n\n    gem install librarian\n    cd chef-repo\n    librarian-chef init\n    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE\n    cookbook 'openoffice',\n      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice.git', :ref => 'v0.2.0'\n    END_OF_CHEFFILE\n    librarian-chef install\n\n## Using knife-github-cookbooks\n\nThe [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports\ninstalling cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the\nplugin:\n\n    gem install knife-github-cookbooks\n    cd chef-repo\n    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-openoffice/v0.2.0\n\n## As a Git Submodule\n\nA common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git\nsubmodules. This is accomplishes like so:\n\n    cd chef-repo\n    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice.git cookbooks/openoffice\n    git submodule init && git submodule update\n\n**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.\n\n## As a Tarball\n\nIf the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef\nServer or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:\n\n    cd chef-repo/cookbooks\n    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice/tarball/v0.2.0 | tar xfz - && \\\n      mv fnichol-chef-openoffice-* openoffice\n\n# Usage\n\nSimply include `recipe[openoffice::headless]` to install OpenOffice headlessly\nand include `recipe[openoffice::apps]` to install the OpenOffice application components.\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\nThis recipe is a no-op and does nothing.\n\n## headless\n\nInstalls the headless (no X) core of OpenOffice.\n\n## apps\n\nInstalls the application components for OpenOffice, namely Writer, Calc, and Impress.\n\n# Attributes\n\nThere are **no** configurable attributes in this cookbook.\n\n# Resources and Providers\n\nThere are **no** resources and providers in this cookbook.\n\n# Development\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.\nIdeally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.\n\n# License and Author\n\nAuthor:: Fletcher Nichol (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\n\nCopyright 2011, Fletcher Nichol\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n[chef_repo]:    https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo\n[java_cb]:      http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/apache2\n[kgc]:          https://github.com/websterclay/knife-github-cookbooks#readme\n[librarian]:    https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian#readme\n\n[repo]:         https://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice\n[issues]:       https://github.com/fnichol/chef-openoffice/issues\n",
