That will cause the recipe to edit the file tomcat-user.xml adding a \"manager\" role, if there is not one already, and adding a \"manager\" user you specify with   default[:psiprobe][:manager_uid]   and   default[:psiprobe][:manager_pwd]\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Martin \"Hasan\" Bramwell (<martinhbramwell (0) gmail o com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2012, FLEETING CLOUDS\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
