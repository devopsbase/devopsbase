You will need to bring your own java cookbook to the party. I don't think its heplful for me to provide some random java cookbook from the internet. It will grab the version of the package from OpenTSDB github where they package all of the code into rpm or deb's. For RHEL it requires gnuplot so that gets installed. However please remember you must bring your own java cookbook or install method. Otherwise it will fail. Here is a quick example of installing java 8 if you need it [Java 8 Install][7].\n\n## Usage\n### Supports\n- Ubuntu\n- CentOS\n\n### Dependencies\n| Name | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| [poise][4] | [Library cookbook][6] built to aide in writing reusable cookbooks. |\n| [poise-service][5] | [Library cookbook][6] built to abstract service management. |\n\n### Attributes\nThe current attributes are all set with the TSDB defaults that are listed here [OpenTSDB Default Options][2]. You can see how they are used/called here [OpenTSDB Library][3]\n\n### Resources/Providers\n\n#### opentsdb_instance\nA default OpenTSDB instance as is easy as below\n\n```\nopentsdb_instance \"test\"\n```\n\nYou Can tune and tweak as you please\n```\nopentsdb_instance \"test\" do\n  bind '127.0.0.1'\n  port 5012\n  core_auto_create_metrics true\n  search_enable true\nend\n```\n\nAs always you can also bring your own config file if you wanted to by calling the source resource. I have provided the default logback.xml file that is provided with the package.\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Anthony Caiafa (<acaiafa1@bloomberg.net>)\n\n```text\nCopyright 2015 Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n[0]: http://blog.vialstudios.com/the-environment-cookbook-pattern#theapplicationcookbook\n[1]: http://opentsdb.net/\n[2]: http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/configuration.html\n[3]: libraries/opentsdb_instance.rb\n[4]: https://github.com/poise/poise\n[5]: https://github.com/poise/poise-service\n[6]: http://blog.vialstudios.com/the-environment-cookbook-pattern#thelibrarycookbook\n[7]: https://github.com/johnbellone/java-service-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/default.rb\n",
