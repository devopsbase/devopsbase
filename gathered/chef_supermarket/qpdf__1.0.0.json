  "readme": "qpdf Cookbook\n=============\n\nInstalls [QPDF][qpdf] and it's runtime/development libraries using\nyour OSs package manager.\n\n[QPDF][qpdf] is a command-line program that does structural,\ncontent-preserving transformations on PDF files.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\nThe [chef-sugar][chef-sugar] library cookbook is used as it provides\nsome nice helpers which are used in this cookbook for switching package\nnames dependant on OS version.\n\nOn RHEL family distros, the \"yum\" cookbook is required for obtaining\nlatest package indexes and adding the EPEL repo which is needed.\n\nOn Debian family distros, the \"apt\" cookbooks is required for obtaining\nlatest package indexes.\n\nPlatforms\n---------\n\nThe following platforms are supported and have been automatically tested under\n[Test Kitchen][testkitchen]:\n\n* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n* Debian 7.5\n* Centos 6.5\n* Amazon Linux (2014.03.1)\n\nOther versions of these OSs should work. Alternative Debian and RHEL\nfamily distributions are also assumed to work. Please [report][issues]\nany additional platforms you have tested so they can be added.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSimply include `recipe[qpdf]` in your run_list to have [QPDF][qpdf]\ninstalled.\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nInstalls [QPDF][qpdf] and it's runtime/development libraries.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nThere are no attributes for this cookbook.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Ideally create a topic branch for every\nseparate change you make.\n\nThis cookbook uses [ChefSpec][chefspec] for unit tests. I also use [Food\nCritic][foodcritic] and [RuboCop][rubocop] to check for style issues.\nWhen contributing it would be very helpful if you could run these via\n`bundle exec spec` and `bundle exec style`.\n\nLastly, there are [Serverspec][serverspec] integration tests for use\nignored. To see all of the available integration test suites just check\n`bundle exec rake T` or `bundle exec kitchen list`, it would be great if\nyou run these tests too, you may however leave out the Amazon Linux test\nsuite if you do not have an AWS account as it runs on an EC2 instance\n(you will be billed for running this).\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: [Ross Timson][rosstimson] <[ross@rosstimson.com](ross@rosstimson.com)>\n\nCopyright 2014, Ross Timson\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n[rosstimson]:         https://github.com/rosstimson\n[repo]:               https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-qpdf\n[issues]:             https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-qpdf/issues\n[qpdf]:               http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/\n[chefsepc]:           https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec\n[foodcritic]:         https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic\n[rubocop]:            https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop\n[serverspec]:         https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec\n[testkitchen]:        https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen\n[chef-sugar]:         https://github.com/sethvargo/chef-sugar\n",
