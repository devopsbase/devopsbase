  "readme": "Description\n===========\nATG Cookbook provides best practices for efficient ATG configuration management of Oracle's ATG Web Commerce core platform. It will handle servers with single to multiple JBoss instances and provides flexibility to determine where you will setup your lock management, global, process and workflow managers. It will also handle port configurations up to 4 instances per jboss server or node.\n\nThis cook book does not install ATG itself or any components nor does it deploy the ears.\n\nIncluded in this cookbook is support for ATG 10.0.x on JBoss 5.1 EAP (10.1 requires slight modifications to accommodate some of the configuration changes in that version)\n\nFor more information about atg cookbook please see http://addolux.com/index.php/services/atg-cookbook\n\nRequirements\n============\n* generic-users and sudo cookbooks.\n* Jboss-atg cookbook which is a customized version of the jboss cookbook originally written by by Bryan W. Berry. Customizations were necessary to to accommodate this ATG cookbook. You also need your own file storage to store JBoss 5.1 eap - preferably a slimmed down version.\n* JAVA cookbook by Seth Chisamore and Bryan Berry\n\nAttributes\n==========\nPlease see attributes file. This file will need to be configured before running.\n\nUsage\n=====\nTo use this cookbook. Go through the atg/attributes/default.rb for proper settings for your environment.\nApply atg instance information to your nodes such as store-a, ca-b and stage-c.\n\n    \"atg\": {\n      \"instances\": [\n        \"store-a\",\n        \"ca-b\",\n        \"staging-c\"\n      ]\n    }\n    \nThe dash letter is called 'slots' and are used to define 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th instances (d is maximum). They will configure the ports for those instances based on the letter you provide.\nYou cannot use for example:\n\n    \"atg\": {\n      \"instances\": [\n        \"store-a\",\n        \"store-a\",  \n        \"ca-b\",\n        \"staging-a\"\n      ]\n    }\n    \nThis will cause your application server to fail due to port conflicts. So its important while you can have multiple stores, you must have unique slot letters.\nThis would be correct method for the above:\n\n    \"atg\": {\n      \"instances\": [\n        \"store-a\",\n        \"store-b\",  \n        \"ca-c\",\n        \"staging-d\"\n      ]\n    }\n\nYou can even do (skipping a letter):\n\n    \"atg\": {\n      \"instances\": [\n        \"store-a\",\n        \"staging-d\"\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    \nLICENSE AND AUTHOR\n==================\n\nAuthor:: John Kip Larsen <john.larsen@addolux.com>\n\nCopyright 2010-2012, Addolux LLC\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n",
