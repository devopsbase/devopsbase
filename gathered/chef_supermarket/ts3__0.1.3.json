  "readme": "# TS3\nLWRPs for installing and configuring TeamSpeak 3 servers.\n\n## Supported Setups\nIn general, an OS is said to be supported if it is listed in `.kitchen.yml` under the platforms section.  \nAlthough all supported OS and job control systems _should_ work, we test using the default systems provided by the OS (for example, systemd on Fedora 23).  \n\n## Usage\nSimply call the `ts3_install` LWRP to handle installing instances and the `ts3_configure` LWRP for configuring pre-existing instances.\n\n## Rakefile\nThe included rakefile has a number of quick-and-dirty tasks defined to make life easier. For example, there are tasks defined to allow one-liners for running tests, style checks, and tagging/deployment.  \nCheck the `Rakefile` out for more information. You can also run `rake -T` to get a listing and description of what each task does.\n\n## Resource Providers\n### ts3_install\nInstalls the TeamSpeak 3 server.\n\n| Attribute | Required? | Type | Default | Usage |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| install_dir | true | String | --- | The location on the filesystem to install the TS3 server to. |\n| version | true | String | --- | The version of the server software to install. |\n\n### ts3_configure\nConfigures a TeamSpeak 3 server.\n\n| Attribute | Required? | Type | Default | Usage |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| user | true | String | teamspeakd | The username of the system account which manages the server. |\n| install_dir | true | String | --- | The location of the server on the filesystem. |\n| server_name | false | String | server | The alias for this server. Used to differentiate job control scripts from one another. |\n| job_control | false | String | manual | The service system used by your hardware. Used to create management scripts automatically. |\n\n#### Job Control types\nThe following job control systems are supported by the LWRP:\n\n| Type | Description\n| :-: | :-:\n| manual | Don't bother installing any scripts, as the server will be managed manually by the administrator.\n| systemd | Install a service for systemd managed by systemctl.\n",
