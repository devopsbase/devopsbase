  "readme": "netgroup Cookbook\n=================\nThis cookbook provides the netgroup LWRP.  It will allow you to manage netgroups in the __/etc/netgroup__ file\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n- Chef 0.10.10+\n\nThe following platforms are known to work:\n\n- Red Hat family (Redhat, CentOS, Oracle etc)\n- This cookbook SHOULD work with any POSIX platform that is chef compliant.  Although testing was only performed on Redhat 5.5 and Redhat 6.X platforms.\n\nAttributes\n----------\nNone\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe netgroup resource has two attributes users and groups. Each attribute is expecting an array of either users or groups.  The default value\nis an empty list so neither attribute is required.  \n\n__The three actions that can be invoked are__\n\n    :manage   : allows chef to manage the resource so it can be referenced in other recipes.  \n    :create   : create the netgroup if it does not exist. If it does it exist bring it into compliance\n    :remove   : remove the netgroup.  \n\nExample usage\n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'netgroup'\n\nnetgroup 'SYSADMIN' do\n  users ['user1','user2']\n  action :create\nend\n\nnetgroup 'SUDOROOT' do\n  users ['user3']\n  groups ['SYSADMIN']\n  action :create\nend\n```\n\nAdding Additional Users and Groups\n----------\nYou can also adjust netgroup resources in other recipes. \n\nFor example. Say the SYSADMIN netgroup resource was loaded in recipe 'A'.  You can add users to this netgroup in \nrecipe 'B' by including the following code. \n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'A'\n\n# Append the users netgroup\nnetgroup_resource = resources(:netgroup => \"SYSADMIN\")\nnetgroup_resource.users netgroup_resource.users + ['user3']\n\n# Overwrite the groups in the SYSADMIN negroup resource\nnetgroup_resource = resources(:netgroup => \"SYSADMIN\")\nnetgroup_resource.groups ['NETGROUP1']\n```\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Stephen M.
