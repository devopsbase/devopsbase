  "readme": "ad-join Cookbook\n============================\n\nThis is a library cookbook that will join a windows computer to a windows AD domain\n\n## Requirements\n\nChef >= 12.5.1  \n\nThis leverages [custom resources](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html) so it will not work on chef versions older than 12.5.1\n\nTested on:\n\nWindows 2012R2  \n\n## Attributes\n\n    default['ad-join']['windows']['update_hostname'] = true\n    \nSet to false if you want the domain name/hostname to be different from the chef node name. (see [#5](https://github.com/NetDocuments/ad-join-cookbook/issues/5)).\n\n    default['ad-join']['windows']['double_reboot'] = true\n\nWill continue to reboot windows until joined to domain and breadcrumb `c:\\\\Windows\\\\chef-ad-join.txt` exists. \n\n    default['ad-join']['windows']['visual_warning'] = false\n\nIf `visual_warning = true`, windows will display a login warning to anyone who connects via RDP to the machine before chef has finished the reboots and the converge. This will override any group policy your company might have in place for displaying custom login messages. \n\n![](http://cl.ly/3l1I1n3X0q1G/Screenshot%202016-01-21%2012.49.45.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nThis cookbook is a library cookbook and is intended to be used by your own wrapper cookbook. See the [recipes directory](./recipes) for examples. \n\nIt contains a custom resource named `domain_join` that takes 4 properties\n\n- domain\n- domain_user\n- domain_password\n- ou\n\nexample:  \n\n```ruby\ndomain_join 'foobar' do\n  domain          'example.com'\n  domain_user     'binduser'\n  domain_password 'correct-horse-battery-staple'\n  ou              'OU=US,OU=West,OU=Web,DC=example,DC=com'\nend\n```\n\nThe ou must be formatted with `OU=` before each organizational unit and `DC=` before each domain component. see [recipes/example_complex.rb](./recipes/example_complex.rb) for an example of how to derive the OU from attributes. \n\n\n### Behind the scenes\n\nIf you bootstrapped the node with the name option; e.g.\n\n    knife bootstrap -N us-web01\n    \nThen that is the name that will be used to join the domain (not the hostname since windows randomly generates it on first boot)\n\n**The name cannot include control characters, leading or trailing spaces, or any of the following characters: / \\\\ [ ].**\n\nIn most cases, Windows hostnames must be 15 characters or less. \n\nThe cookbook creates a windows scheduled task that runs chef as soon as the VM is started. The scheduled task is deleted after all the reboots. \n\nThe cookbook will restart windows twice since some group policy objects (like the time zone) are not applied on first boot. You can change this behavior by changing the following attribute to false. \n\n    default['ad-join']['windows']['double_reboot'] = true  \n\n\nLicense and Authors\n-------------------\nAuthors:  \nVolodymyr Babchynskyy vbabch@softserveinc.com  \nSpencer Owen sowen@netdocuments.com  \n",
