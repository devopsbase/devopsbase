  "readme": "now cookbook\n============\nThis cookbook is a pure library cookbook that monkey patches the core\nChef DSL to provide a method called `include_recipes_now`. This method\nwill converge a recipe immediately, as it is encountered during\ncompilation. This is meant to avoid the \"compile phase\" arms race\ncreated by over-use and abuse of .run_action. It is not meant to be a\npermanent solution for achieving this behavior and should be used only \nsparingly, with full understanding of what is happening. \n\nA more permanent solution is expected in Chef 12. Technique borrowed\nfrom Poise. https://github.com/poise/poise\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Noah Kantrowitz (<noah@coderanger.net>)\n- Author:: Sean OMeara (<someara@getchef.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2014 Chef\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n"
