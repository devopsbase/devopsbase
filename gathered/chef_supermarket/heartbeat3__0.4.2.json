  "readme": "# Description\n\nInstalls and configures heartbeat.\n\n# Requirements\n\n## Chef\n\nTested on 0.10.8 but newer and older version should work just fine.\n\n## Platform\n\nThe following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the\nrecipes run on these platforms without error:\n\n* ubuntu\n* debian\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nThere are **no** external cookbook dependencies. \n\n# Installation\n\nJust place the heartbeat3 directory in your chef cookbook directory and\nupload it to your Chef server.\n\n# Usage\n\nSimply add recipe[heartbeat] to the run list of the servers that will integrate \nthe heartbeat cluster. You can edit the file file/default/authkeys in order to add \nmore security to your heartbeat cluster.\n\nThis cookbook doesn't have templates, all configuration files are generated dinamically \ndepending of the keys and their values of the attributes hashes.\n\nConfiguration example:\n\n    node['heartbeat']['ha_cf']['logfacility'] = \"local0\"\n    node['heartbeat']['ha_cf']['auto_failback'] = \"off\"\n    node['heartbeat']['ha_cf']['ucast'] = \"eth0 1.1.1.1\"\n    node['heartbeat\"]['ha_cf']['node'] = [ \"node1\", \"node2\" ]\n\n    node[\"heartbeat\"][\"haresources\"] = [\n      {\n        \"node\" => \"node1\",\n        \"resources\" => [\n          \"IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24/eth0/135.9.8.210\",\n          \"135.9.216.3/28/eth0/135.9.216.12 httpd\",\n          \"10.0.0.170 Filesystem::/dev/sda1::/data1::ext2\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n\nWill generate the following /etc/ha.d/ha.cf file:\n\n    logfacility local0\n    auto_failback off\n    ucast eth0 1.1.1.1\n    node node1\n    node node2\n\nAnd the following /etc/ha.d/haresources file:\n    node 1 \\\n            IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24/eth0/135.9.8.210 \\\n            135.9.216.3/28/eth0/135.9.216.12 httpd \\\n            10.0.0.170 Filesystem::/dev/sda1::/data1::ext2\n\n# Recipes\n\n## default\n\nInstalls and configures Heartbeat according the settings of the node attributes. Also it disables de services set in the `node['heartbeat']['services']` attribute.\n\n## services\n\nThis recipe will sanitize the services that are set in the `node['heartbeat']['services']` attribute in order to Chef doesn't start them in the inactive node.\n\n# Attributes\n\n## `ha_cf`\n\nHash that contains the parameters of the /etc/ha.d/ha.cf file. If the elements are\narrays, they will be added with the same parameter but with different values.\n\n## `services`\n\nIt could be `false` or an array that contains the services that will be managed by heartbeat.\n\n## `haresources`\n\nIt could be `false` or it could be an array of hashes with the resources definitions. \nIf it is false, the /etc/ha.d/haresources will not be generated.\n\n# Resources and Providers\n\nThis cookbook provide some service providers that override some actions in order to them couln't be started by Chef.\n\n# Libraries\n\nThere are **none** defined.\n\n# Development\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.\nIdeally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.\n\n# License and Author\n\nAuthor:: Claudio Cesar Sanchez Tejeda <demonccc@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright:: 2012, Claudio Cesar Sanchez Tejeda\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n[repo]:         https://github.com/demonccc/chef-repo\n[issues]:       https://github.com/demonccc/chef-repo/issues\n",
