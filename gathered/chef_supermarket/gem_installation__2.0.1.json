  "readme": "# Description\n\nProvides a set of LWRPs to install ruby gems and/or their package dependencies, before or during convergence.  \nIf you are sick and tired of manually installing libxml2-dev and libxslt-dev, this cookbook is dedicated to you.\n\nDoes not install the rubygems binary.\n\nYou probably don't want to use this, it's not well done and semi abandoned, but I haven't found a better solution yet.\n\n# Update notes from previous versions\n\n * You must include the `gem_installation::default` recipe now. This is the sad result of some internal rejiggering\n\n# Warning\n\nCurrently, the prerequisites are hardcoded in libraries/gem_installation.rb\n\nWhile a solution utilizing a dependency resolver would be great, for now this is much better than nothing, and the LWRP interface is unlikely to change anyway.\n\n# Platforms\n\nUbuntu and Debian. Check [.kitchen.yml](https://github.com/promisedlandt/cookbook-gem_installation/blob/master/.kitchen.yml) for the exact versions tested.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\n# Set up everything this cookbook needs\ninclude_recipe \"gem_installation::default\"\n\n# Install fog before convergence so you can use it in your chef recipes\ngem_installation \"fog\"\n\n# Install fog during convergence\ngem_installation \"nokogiri\" do\n  action :install\nend\n\n# Install the nokogiri dependencies during convergence (e.g. because you deploy a Ruby application that has nokogiri in it's bundle).\n# Note: does not install nokogiri itself, only the dependencies\ngem_installation_dependencies \"nokogiri\" \n\n# Install fog dependencies before convergence (e.g. because you include a third party cookbook that will install fog as a chef_gem).\n# Once again, the fog gem itself is not installed\ngem_installation_dependencies \"fog\" do\n  action :install_before_convergence\nend\n```\n\n# Recipes\n\n## gem_installation::default\n\nInstalls the [deep_merge](https://github.com/danielsdeleo/deep_merge) gem, which this cookbook depends on.\n\nAlso includes build-essential, so you're able to build native extensions.\n\n# Attributes\n\nCurrently, no attributes are used by this cookbook.\n\n# Resources / Providers\n\nNote that the default actions for the two LWRPs are the opposite of each other.  \nWhile this is inconsistent, it reflects the expected use cases.\n\n## gem_installation\n\nDeals with gem installation, including dependencies\n\n### Attributes\n\nAttribute | Description | Type | Default\n----------|-------------|------|--------\ngem_name | Name of the gem to install | String | name\n\n### Actions\n\nName | Description | Default\n-----|-------------|--------\ninstall_before_convergence | Installs the named gem as a chef_gem | yes\ninstall | Installs the named gem using gem_package |\n\n## gem_installation_dependencies\n\nInstall only gem dependencies, not the gems themselves.\n\n### Attributes\n\nAttribute | Description | Type | Default\n----------|-------------|------|--------\ngem_name | Dependencies of this gem will be installed | String | name\n\n### Actions\n\nName | Description | Default\n-----|-------------|--------\ninstall | Installs prerequisites during convergence | yes\ninstall_before_convergence | Installs prerequisites before convergence |\n",
