  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nInstall the Cloud Foundry [health_manager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/health_manager),\na mandatory component of a [Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.org)\ninstallation.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\n* Ubuntu\n\nTested on:\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04\n* Ubuntu 12.04\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\n* cloudfoundry\n* cloudfoundry-cloud_controller\n* rbenv\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis cookbook will install the CloudFoundry Health Manager on the target\nnode along with the necessary configuration files and init scripts to\nrun it. Because the database required by a Health Manager is shared with\nthe CloudController, you need to use the\n`cloudfoundry-cloud_controller::database` recipe from the\n`cloudfoundry-cloud_controller` cookbook to setup the Health Manager's\ndatabase. Assuming you're running a Health Manager on the same machine\nas your Cloud Controller, typical usage in a recipe will look like so:\n\n    include_recipe \"cloudfoundry-cloud_controller\"\n    include_recipe \"cloudfoundry-health_manager\"\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['log_level']` - The Health Manager's log level. Default is `info\"`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['log_file']` - Where to write the Health Manager's logs. Default is `File.join(node['cloudfoundry']['log_dir'], \"health_manager.log\")`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['pid_file']` - Where to write the Health Manager's pid file. Default is `File.join(node['cloudfoundry']['pid_dir'], \"health_manager.pid\")`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['database_scan']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `60`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['droplet_lost']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `30`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['droplet_analysis']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `10`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['flapping_death']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `3`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['flapping_timeout']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `180`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['restart_timeout']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `20`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry_health_manager']['stable_state']` - TODO (trotter): Find out what this does. Default is `60`.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n* Author:: Andrea Campi (<andrea.campi@zephirworks.com>)\n* Author:: Trotter Cashion (<cashion@gmail.com>)\n\n* Copyright:: 2012-2013 ZephirWorks\n* Copyright:: 2012 Trotter Cashion\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
