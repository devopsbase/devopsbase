Please refer to `attributes/agents_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::agents_package]` in a runlist.\n\n**Note:** this recipe merely makes the Dynatrace Agents available, but it does not configure your application to actually load any. See the `java_agent` recipe for an example that does.\n\n### apache_wsagent\n\n*Installs the Dynatrace WebServer Agent for the Apache HTTP Server.*\n\nDownload the Dynatrace WebServer Agent installer from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-wsagent.tar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['wsagent_package']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/apache_wsagent.rb` and `attributes/wsagent_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::apache_wsagent]` in a runlist.\n\n**Note:** you will have to restart the web server after placing the agent.\n\n### collector\n\n*Installs the Dynatrace Collector.*\n\nDownload the Dynatrace Collector installer from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-collector.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory.

In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::collector]` in a runlist.\n\n**Note:** make sure that attributes related to the Collector's memory configuration are set in accordance to the [Memory Configuration](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT60/Collector+Configuration#CollectorConfiguration-MemoryConfiguration) section of the [Collector Configuration](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT60/Collector+Configuration) documentation.\n\n### dotnet_agent\n\n*Installs the Dynatrace .NET Agent.*\n\nDownload the Dynatrace Agents package from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-agents.jar` (Linux) or in `dynatrace-agents.msi` (Windows) in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['agents_package'][...]['installer']['file_url']` attribute.

It is assumed that this script either executes the Java process directly or is sourced by another script before the Java process gets executed.

In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::wsagent_package]` in a runlist.\n\n**Note:** this recipe merely makes the Dynatrace WebServer Agent available, but it does not configure your web server to actually load it. See the `apache_wsagent` and `iis_agent`recipes for examples.\n\n## Testing\n\nWe use [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) to automatically test our automated deployments with [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/):\n\n1) Install Test Kitchen and its dependencies from within the project's directory:\n\n```\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\n```\n\n2) Run all tests\n\n```\nkitchen test\n```\n\nBy default, we run our tests inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers as this considerably speeds up testing time (see `.kitchen.yml`, requires Ruby 2.2+). Alternatively, you may as well run these tests in virtual machines based on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (see `.kitchen.vagrant.yml`).\n\n## Platforms\n\n### Linux\n\n- CentOS 6.5\n- Debian 7.4\n- Ubuntu 12.04\n\n### Windows\n\n- Windows 2012 R2\n\n## Questions?\n\nFeel free to post your questions on the Dynatrace Community's [Continuous Delivery Forum](https://answers.dynatrace.com/spaces/148/open-q-a_2.html?topics=continuous%20delivery).\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the MIT License.
