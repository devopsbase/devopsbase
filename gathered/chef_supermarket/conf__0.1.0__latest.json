  "readme": "Description\n===========\n\nLWRP to manage configuration files.\n\nRight now the LWRP manages plain files but INI files are also planned to be managed.\nThe actions that can be done by this LWRP over plain files are:\n\n* `:append` - Append a line at the end of the file\n* `:remove` - Remove a specific line whith match with a passed pattern\n* `:replace` - Replace a specific line with a new line\n* `:insert_after_match` - Search for a pattern and insert a line after if it's found\n* `:insert_if_not_match` - Search for a pattern and append a line if the pattern isn't found\n\nYou can add the recipe `conf` to a node `run_list`, so all the recipes from\nthat runlist can use the resources and providers.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nIn order to use this LWRP from your cookbook or recipe you need to add\nthis cookbook as a dependency at the `metadata.rb` file.\nBut as long as `chef-client` doesn't manage the dependencies, you'll need\nto add the cookbook also to the node's `run_list`.\n\nAfter doing that you can do things like:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/etc/hosts' do\n      pattern  /test\\.mydomain/\n      new_line '127.0.0.1    test.mydomain.com'\n      action   :insert_if_no_match\n    end\n\nWhich will insert the `new_line` if the file doesn't contain the _pattern_\n`/test.mydomain/`.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo see how this works and how could be used from another cookbook, let's see\nsome examples.\n\nLet's say we have a file named `/tmp/file.txt` which content is:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n    2 - Second line\n    3 - Third line\n    4 - Last line\n\n\nTo replace one line with another one, we can do from our recipe:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/tmp/file.txt' do\n      current_line '2 - Second line'\n      new_line     '2 - The new Second line'\n      action :replace\n    end\n\nThe result content will be:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n    2 - The new Second line\n    3 - Third line\n    4 - Last line\n\n\nTo append one line we can do this:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/tmp/file.txt' do\n      new_line     '5 - New Last Line'\n      action :append\n    end\n\nThe result content will be:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n    2 - Second line\n    3 - Third line\n    4 - Last line\n    5 - New Last Line\n\n\nTo remove one specific line:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/tmp/file.txt' do\n      pattern /Third/\n      action :remove\n    end\n\nThe result content will be:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n    2 - Second line\n    4 - Last line\n\n\nTo append a line with some text if the text doesn't is yet at the file:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/tmp/file.txt' do\n      pattern   /6 -/\n      new_line  '6 - A new line six'\n      action :insert_if_no_match\n    end\n\nThe result content will be:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n    2 - Second line\n    3 - Third line\n    4 - Last line\n    6 - A new line six\n\n\nTo insert a line in the file after another line but not at the end:\n\n    conf_plain_file '/vagrant/insert_after_match.txt' do\n      pattern   /First/\n      new_line  '  1.5 - Almost second line'\n      action :insert_after_match\n    end\n\nThe result content will be:\n\n    0 - Line zero\n    1 - First line\n      1.5 - Almost second line\n    2 - Second line\n    3 - Third line\n    4 - Last line\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Juanje Ojeda <juanje.ojeda@gmail.com>\n\nCopyright:: 2011 Junta de Andaluc√≠a\nCopyright:: 2012 Juanje Ojeda <juanje.ojeda@gmail.com>\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n"
