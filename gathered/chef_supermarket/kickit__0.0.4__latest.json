  "readme": "kickit\n======\n\nConfigures the kickit ruby script that runs as a daemon and listens for an http connection on port 5425 (KICK).\n\nTo kickit, visit `http://your.host.name:5425/` in a browser\n\nWARNING\n------\n\nDo not use this in a production or on an internet facing host. It has not been tested and is not secured.\n\nRequirements\n-----------\n\n* Currently chef-client needs to be run as a daemon for this to work but this will change in the future\n\nFiles\n-----\n\n- kickit.rb - Tiny http server script that runs as a daemon\n- kickit.conf.upstart - Ubuntu upstart script\n- kickit.plist - OSX Launchd config file\n\nUsage\n----\n\nAdd a depends for the kickit cookbook in your metadata.rb\n``` ruby\ndepends 'kickit'\n```\n\nInclude the kickit cookbook somewhere that makes sense\n``` ruby\ninclude_recipe 'kickit'\n```\n\nPlatform Support\n----------------\n\nCurrent tested on...\n- Ubuntu - 12.04, 13.04\n- OSX - Mavericks\n\nToDo List\n----------------\n\n* Migrate away from requring chef to run as a daemon and manage the entire life cycle of chef-client\n* Watch the lockfile to ensure completion possibly with a timeout (thanks to tips from coderanger)\n\n"
