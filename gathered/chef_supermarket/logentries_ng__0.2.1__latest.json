Unfortunately, when you install the `logentries-daemon` package it immediately tries to start the agent and will fail if you haven't pre-configured your host settings; this is problematic in a Chef script, because we haven't had an opportunity to set things up yet.\n\nTo solve this problem, the commandline tools are installed immediately, then the `logentries-daemon` package will only be installed at the end of your chef run; it will be triggered by the use of any of the `logentries` definitions.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5. Create new Pull Request\n\n## License\n\n**logentries_ng**\n\n* Freely distributable and licensed under the MIT license.\n* Copyright (c) 2014 Konstantin Lysenko (gshaud@gmail.com)\n* Copyright (c) 2012 James Gregory (james@jagregory.com)\n* http://www.jagregory.com\n* [@jagregory](http://twitter.com/jagregory)\n",
