  "readme": "logstash-forwarder config example\n=================================\n\nThis is an example of configuring a docker image by inheritance.\n\nYou can see the only thing we have in the Dockerfile is copying local files into the image.\nThe etc directory is holding our example config, potentially this is your private config that you don't want to be publicly availible.\n\nThis example doesn't work out of the box, you should replace the crt file with a real one you are using, (etc/logstash-forwarder/server.crt)\nand change logs.example.com to your real server inside etc/logstash-forwarder/logstash-forwarder-config.json\n\nThis example json config tries to catch all files in the 1st 2 levels of /var/log which is a common log path.\nThis would potentially allow you to have all your nodes run just one logstash forwarder container, as your log aggregator, no matter what application containers you are running.\n\nThe resulting image shouldi potentially be stored as a private one, not in the public docker hub.\n\nHow you can use this image:\n 1. Fork it and change what you need. (minimally just the 2 files mentioned above)\n 2. Just read it as an example usage that is valid for most of our other images.\n 3. you might still use this image with the volumes trick where you mount the config directory and change it locally on the node your deploy on.\n",
