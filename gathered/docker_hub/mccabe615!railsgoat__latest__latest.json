  "readme": "# RailsGoat [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/OWASP/railsgoat.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OWASP/railsgoat) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/OWASP/railsgoat.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/OWASP/railsgoat)\n\nRailsGoat is a vulnerable version of the Ruby on Rails Framework both versions 3 and 4. It includes vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10, as well as some \"extras\" that the initial project contributors felt worthwhile to share. This project is designed to educate both developers, as well as security professionals.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you are looking for support or troubleshooting assistance, please visit our [OWASP Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-railsgoat/). \n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo begin, install the Ruby Version Manager (RVM):\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=3 --ruby=2.3.1\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, clone this repo:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:OWASP/railsgoat.git\n```\n\n**NOTE: NOT NECESSARY IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH RAILS 4.** Otherwise, if you wish to use the Rails 3 version, you'll need to switch branches \n\n```bash\n$ cd railsgoat\n$ git checkout rails_3_2\n```\n\nNavigate into the directory (already there if you followed the previous step) and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ bundle install\n```\n\nIf you receive an error, make sure you have `bundler` installed:\n\n```bash\n$ gem install bundler\n```\n\nInitialize the database:\n\n```bash\n$ rake db:setup\n```\n\nStart the Thin web server:\n\n```bash\n$ rails server\n```\n\nOpen your favorite browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start hacking!\n\n## Vagrant Install\n\nTo run Railsgoat with Vagrant you must first have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. Once those dependencies are installed cd into the Railsgoat directory where you've cloned the code and run.\n\n```\n#~/code/railsgoat\n$ vagrant up\n...\n    railsgoat:   Port: 3000:3000\n    railsgoat:  \n    railsgoat: Container created: 3084633a81675346\n==> railsgoat: Starting container...\n==> railsgoat: Provisioners will not be run since container doesn't support SSH.\n$\n```\nOnce you see the preceeding message Railsgoat is running on your localhost on port 3000.\n\nOpen your favorite browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start hacking!\n\n## Docker Install\nTo run Railsgoat with Docker you must first have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. Once those dependencies are installed, cd into the Railsgoat directory where you've cloned the code and run. Rails requires Compose **1.6.0** or above and require a Docker Engine of version **1.10.0** or above.\n\n```\n#~/code/railsgoat\n$ docker-compose build\n$ docker-compose run web rake db:setup\n$ docker-compose up\n...\n  Creating railsgoat_web_1\n  Attaching to railsgoat_web_1\n$\n```\nOnce you see the preceeding message Railsgoat is running on your localhost on port 3000.\n\nOpen your favorite browser, navigate to `http://<dockerIP>:3000` and start hacking! The Docker IP is usually `192.168.99.100`. Run `docker-machine env` to verify.\n\nNote: if your container exits with an error, it may be because a server is already running:\n```\nA server is already running. Check /myapp/tmp/pids/server.pid.\n=> Booting Thin\n=> Rails 4.2.6 application starting in development on\nhttp://0.0.0.0:3000\n=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options\n=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server\nExiting\n```\nIn this case, remove that server.pid file and try again. Note also that this file is in your current working directory, not inside the container.\n\n## Capybara Tests\n\nRailsGoat now includes a set of failing Capybara RSpecs, each one indicating that a separate vulnerability exists in the application. To run them, you first need to install [PhantomJS](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs), which is required by the Poltergeist Capybara driver. Upon installation, simply run the following rake task:\n\n```\n$ rake training\n```\n\nTo run just one spec:\n\n```\n$ rake training SPEC=spec/vulnerabilities/sql_injection_spec.rb\n```\n\nNOTE: As vulnerabilities are fixed in the application, these specs will not change to `passing`, but to `pending`.\n\n\n## MySQL Environment\n\nBy default in development mode Railsgoat runs with a SQLite database. There is an environment defined to use MySQL. For some of the SQL injection vulnerabilities to work you have to run the app with MySQL as the database. The following steps will setup and run Railsgoat to use MySQL. *MySQL must be installed and running before running these steps*\n\n```\n#Create the MySQL database\nRAILS_ENV=mysql rake db:create\n\n#Run the migrations against the database\nRAILS_ENV=mysql rake db:migrate\n\n#Boot Rails using MySQl\nRAILS_ENV=mysql rails s\n```\n\n## Processing Email\n\nIn order for RailsGoat to effectively process email, you will first need to run MailCatcher, an SMTP server that will intercept email messages and display them in a web interface.\n\nTo start an instance of MailCatcher, simply run:\n\n```\n$ mailcatcher\n```\n\nIf successful, you should see the following output:\n\n```\nStarting MailCatcher\n==> smtp://127.0.0.1:1025\n==> http://127.0.0.1:1080\n*** MailCatcher runs as a daemon by default. Go to the web interface to quit.\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run MailCatcher in the foreground by running `mailcatcher -f` in your terminal.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs changes are made to the application, the Capybara RSpecs can be used to verify that the vulnerabilities in the application are still intact. To use them in this way, and have them `pass` instead of `fail`, set the `RAILSGOAT_MAINTAINER` environment variable.\n\nConversion to the OWASP Top Ten 2013 completed in November, 2013.\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 The Open Web Application Security Project\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
