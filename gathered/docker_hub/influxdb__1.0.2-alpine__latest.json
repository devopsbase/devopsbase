This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Finfluxdb).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/influxdb/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/influxdb/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# InfluxDB\n\nInfluxDB is a time series database built from the ground up to handle high write and query loads. InfluxDB is meant to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts of timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.\n\n[InfluxDB Documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/43d87118415bb75d7bb107683e79cd6d69186f67/influxdb/logo.png)\n\n## Using this Image\n\n### Running the container\n\nThe InfluxDB image exposes a shared volume under `/var/lib/influxdb`, so you can mount a host directory to that point to access persisted container data. A typical invocation of the container might be:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 \\\n      -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb \\\n      influxdb\n```\n\nModify `$PWD` to the directory where you want to store data associated with the InfluxDB container.\n\nYou can also have Docker control the volume mountpoint by using a named volume.\n\n```console\n$ docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 \\\n      -v influxdb:/var/lib/influxdb \\\n      influxdb\n```\n\n### Exposed Ports\n\nThe following ports are important and are used by InfluxDB.\n\n-\t8086 HTTP API port\n-\t8083 Administrator interface port\n\nThe HTTP API port will be automatically exposed when using `docker run -P`.\n\nThe administrator interface is not automatically exposed when using `docker run -P`. While the administrator interface is run by default, the adminstrator interface requires that the web browser have access to InfluxDB on the same port in the container as from the web browser. Since `-P` exposes the HTTP port to the host on a random port, the administrator interface is not compatible with this setting.\n\nFind more about API Endpoints & Ports [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/concepts/api/).\n\n### Configuration\n\nInfluxDB can be either configured from a config file or using environment variables. To mount a configuration file and use it with the server, you can use this command:\n\nGenerate the default configuration file:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --rm influxdb influxd config > influxdb.conf\n```\n\nModify the default configuration, which will now be available under `$PWD`. Then start the InfluxDB container.\n\n```console\n$ docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 \\\n      -v $PWD/influxdb.conf:/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf:ro \\\n      influxdb -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf\n```\n\nModify `$PWD` to the directory where you want to store the configuration file.\n\nFor environment variables, the format is `INFLUXDB_$SECTION_$NAME`. All dashes (`-`) are replaced with underscores (`_`). If the variable isn't in a section, then omit that part.\n\nExamples:\n\n```console\nINFLUXDB_REPORTING_DISABLED=true\nINFLUXDB_META_DIR=/path/to/metadir\nINFLUXDB_DATA_QUERY_LOG_ENABLED=false\n```\n\nFind more about configuring InfluxDB [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/introduction/installation/)\n\n### Graphite\n\nInfluxDB supports the Graphite line protocol, but the service and ports are not exposed by default. To run InfluxDB with Graphite support enabled, you can either use a configuration file or set the appropriate environment variables. Run InfluxDB with the default Graphite configuration:\n\n```console\ndocker run -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 \\\n    -e INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_ENABLED=true \\\n    influxdb\n```\n\nSee the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/services/graphite/README.md) for more detailed documentation to set up the Graphite service. In order to take advantage of graphite templates, you should use a configuration file by outputting a default configuration file using the steps above and modifying the `[[graphite]]` section.\n\n### HTTP API\n\nCreating a DB named mydb:\n\n```console\n$ curl -G http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode \"q=CREATE DATABASE mydb\"\n```\n\nInserting into the DB:\n\n```console\n$ curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'cpu_load_short,host=server01,region=us-west value=0.64 1434055562000000000'\n```\n\nRead more about this in the [official documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/guides/writing_data/)\n\n### CLI / SHELL\n\nStart the container:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name=influxdb -d -p 8083:8083 -p 8086:8086 influxdb\n```\n\nRun the influx client in another container:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --rm --net=container:influxdb -it influxdb influx -host influxdb\n```\n\nAt the moment, you cannot use `docker exec` to run the influx client since `docker exec` will not properly allocate a TTY. This is due to a current bug in Docker that is detailed in [docker/docker#8755](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8755).\n\n### Web Administrator Interface\n\nNavigate to [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) with your browser while running the container.\n\nSee more about using the web administrator interface [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/tools/web_admin/).\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `influxdb` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `influxdb:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of [`buildpack-deps`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). `buildpack-deps` is designed for the average user of docker who has many images on their system. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages. This reduces the number of packages that images that derive from it need to install, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.\n\n## `influxdb:alpine`\n\nThis image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.\n\nThis variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.\n\nTo minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/LICENSE) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdata-docker/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdata-docker/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`influxdb/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/influxdb) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
