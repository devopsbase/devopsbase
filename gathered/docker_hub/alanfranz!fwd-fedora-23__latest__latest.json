  "readme": "# fpm-within-docker\n\nPre-baked images for RPM and DEB package building. [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) is included!\n\nCentos 5 and 6 images are stuck (and will be probably stuck forever) to fpm 1.4.0 because of system limitations.\nAll other images should be updated to the latest FPM version, currently: **1.5.0**.\n\n## what does this do?\n\nIf you don't want to spend your nights in learning packaging an RPM or a DEB - which is a good idea - FPM can help.\nBut, out of the box, fpm doesn't provide a \"sandbox\" or any other \"isolated environment\" for building. Here comes this set of images.\n\nYou should still know something about package building.\n\nFor RPM see [Maximum RPM](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/), [Fedora RPM Howto](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package), or [Fedora RPM Guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/).\n\nFor DEB, see [Debian How To Package](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian) or [Ubuntu Packaging New Software](http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html).\n\nYou'd better know what [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is, as well.\n\n## Usage\n\nTake a look at the example in the [example project](example-project) directory - it's an example build of a [lua interpreter](http://www.lua.org)\nfor Centos7 and Ubuntu Trusty. The directory contains the extracted source of lua 5.3.1, while the [packaging](example-project/packaging) dir contains our build scripts. The main build scripts are commented and will tell you what you should know: see [build for centos 7](example-project/packaging/centos-7/build) and [build for ubuntu trusty](example-project/packaging/ubuntu-trusty/build)\n\nThe build chain goes something like this:\n\n* first, a build-image is constructed via docker. That usually inherits from an fpm-within-docker image.\n* Then, a build script is run into that image. Such build script can access the software source, which is usually employed to build and install the software; then fpm is invoked to package it.\n* After that, a test-image is constructed via docker. That doesn't inherit from an fpm-within-docker image; an image as bare as possible should be used.\n* As a last step, a test script is invoked. Such script should install the package that was just built and run the test suite for the software, which can then be tested in an environment very close to actual scenario. This is especially useful to detect issues with missing or broken dependencies.\n\nI suggest you just **copy** the whole packaging directory from the examples to your own project, then you add/remove the various distro-related subdirectories and modify them in place.\n\n## Goodies\n\nDebian and Ubuntu images already include [apt-current](https://github.com/alanfranz/apt-current) for easier\ninstall and maintenance of images based on apt distributions. Please note: apt-current gets configured with **CLEANUP_DOWNLOADED_LISTS=true** by default;\nit is hence recommended that you run apt/apt-get install only once in your build files, or that you change the configuration, otherwise your build\nmay be unnecessary slow because of multiple update commands being issues.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nCurrently the images are x86_64 only. There's an exception for\ncentos5 i386, since I had an actual use case, but its creation\nwas very tedious, and docker doesn't officially endorse 32 bit guests.\n\nI'll add 32 bit images only if help is provided.\n\n## Using the fpm-within-docker images\n\nThey're available on Docker hub, so they can be used straight from your docker command line, without the need of rebuilding them locally.\n\n[fpm-within-docker images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=alanfranz%2Ffwd&starCount=0)\n\nAll images are tagged \"latest\" and are x86_64 unless otherwise noted. i386 images are\nunsupported and experimental.\n\nI'll usually add images for Centos, Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian as soon\nas they get out, and I'll try supporting them as long as they're supported upstream.\n\nImage list:\n\n* alanfranz/fwd-centos-5-i386:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-centos-6:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-centos-7:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-debian-jessie:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-debian-wheezy:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-fedora-22:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-fedora-23:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-fedora-rawhide:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-ubuntu-precise:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-ubuntu-trusty:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-ubuntu-wily:latest\n* alanfranz/fwd-ubuntu-xenial:latest\n\n## Signing RPMs\n\nFpm supports signing rpms, but there's a minimum of setup involved; check the [build for centos 7](example-project/packaging/centos-7/build) to see \nhow it's done. You can both sign and verify the signature is OK.\n\nDEB packages are signed in the repository only, so no issue while building.\n",
