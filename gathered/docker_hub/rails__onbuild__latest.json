  "readme": "# **DEPRECATED**\n\nThis image is officially deprecated in favor of [the standard `ruby` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/), and will receive no further updates after 2016-12-31 (Dec 31, 2016). Please adjust your usage accordingly.\n\nFor most usages of this image, it was already not bringing in `rails` from this image, but actually from your project's `Gemfile`, so the only \"value\" being added here was the pre-installing of `nodejs`, `mysql-client`, `postgresql-client`, and `sqlite3` for various uses of the `rails` framework.\n\nFor example, a `Dockerfile` similar to the following would be a good starting point for a Rails project using PostgreSQL:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ruby:2.3\n\nRUN apt-get update \\\n\t&& apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n\t\tpostgresql-client \\\n\t&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY Gemfile* ./\nRUN bundle install\nCOPY . .\n\nEXPOSE 3000\nCMD [\"rails\", \"server\", \"-b\", \"0.0.0.0\"]\n```\n\n# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links\n\n-\t[`5.0.0.1`, `5.0.0`, `5.0`, `5`, `latest` (*Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/docker-library/rails/blob/74262f5482517f779681590b0194758ff75cf77c/Dockerfile)\n-\t[`onbuild` (*onbuild/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/docker-library/rails/blob/9df9b5e6b1519faf22e1565c2caaebf7cc1c665b/onbuild/Dockerfile)\n\nFor more information about this image and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/rails`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/rails). This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Frails).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/rails/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/rails/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is Ruby on Rails?\n\nRuby on Rails or, simply, Rails is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework. This means that \"out of the box\", Rails can create pages and applications that gather information from a web server, talk to or query a database, and render templates. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/01c12653951b2fe592c1f93a13b4e289ada0e3a1/rails/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\n## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Rails app project\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM rails:onbuild\n```\n\nPut this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.\n\nThis image includes multiple `ONBUILD` triggers which should cover most applications. The build will `COPY . /usr/src/app`, `RUN bundle install`, `EXPOSE 3000`, and set the default command to `rails server`.\n\nYou can then build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t my-rails-app .\n$ docker run --name some-rails-app -d my-rails-app\n```\n\nYou can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:3000` in a browser or, if you need access outside the host, on port 8080:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-rails-app -p 8080:3000 -d my-rails-app\n```\n\nYou can then go to `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.\n\n### Generate a `Gemfile.lock`\n\nThe `onbuild` tag expects a `Gemfile.lock` in your app directory. This `docker\nrun` will help you generate one. Run it in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --rm -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app ruby:2.1 bundle install\n```\n\n## Bootstrap a new Rails application\n\nIf you want to generate the scaffolding for a new Rails project, you can do the following:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -it --rm --user \"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app rails rails new --skip-bundle webapp\n```\n\nThis will create a sub-directory named `webapp` inside your current directory.\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `rails` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `rails:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.\n\n## `rails:onbuild`\n\nThis image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating a `Dockerfile` in the base of your project directory with the line `FROM rails:onbuild` will be enough to create a stand-alone image for your project.\n\nWhile the `onbuild` variant is really useful for \"getting off the ground running\" (zero to Dockerized in a short period of time), it's not recommended for long-term usage within a project due to the lack of control over *when* the `ONBUILD` triggers fire (see also [`docker/docker#5714`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5714), [`docker/docker#8240`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8240), [`docker/docker#11917`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/11917)).\n\nOnce you've got a handle on how your project functions within Docker, you'll probably want to adjust your `Dockerfile` to inherit from a non-`onbuild` variant and copy the commands from the `onbuild` variant `Dockerfile` (moving the `ONBUILD` lines to the end and removing the `ONBUILD` keywords) into your own file so that you have tighter control over them and more transparency for yourself and others looking at your `Dockerfile` as to what it does. This also makes it easier to add additional requirements as time goes on (such as installing more packages before performing the previously-`ONBUILD` steps).\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](https://github.com/rails/rails#license) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/rails/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/rails/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`rails/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/rails) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
