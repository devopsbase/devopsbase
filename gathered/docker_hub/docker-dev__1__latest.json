Please adjust your usage accordingly.\n\n# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links\n\n-\t[`1.9.1`, `1.9`, `1` (*Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/a34a1d598c6096ed8b5ce5219e77d68e5cd85462/Dockerfile)\n\n[![](https://badge.imagelayers.io/docker-dev:1.9.1.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=docker-dev:1.9.1)\n\nFor more information about this image and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/docker-dev`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/docker-dev). This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fdocker-dev).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `docker-dev/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/docker-dev/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs).\n\n# What is Docker?\n\nDocker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating systemâ€“level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent \"containers\" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting virtual machines.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/b449be7df57e9ed9086bb5821bfb5d6cdc5d67a4/docker-dev/logo.png)\n\n# About this image\n\nThis image contains the building and testing environment of the Docker project itself, from which the official releases are made.\n\nIf you are looking for an up-to-date development environment for doing development work on Docker's `master` branch, you should use [`dockercore/docker`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dockercore/docker/) instead. It's an automated build of [`github.com/docker/docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker)'s `master` branch, and is maintained by the Docker core team.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.11.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`docker-dev/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/docker-dev) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.",
