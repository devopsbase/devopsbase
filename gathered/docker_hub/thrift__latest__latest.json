  "readme": "# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links\n\n-\t[`0.9`, `0.9.3`, `latest` (*0.9/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift/blob/d322572f7dd6ea468a14a4d832fbec26f152c71e/0.9/Dockerfile)\n\nFor more information about this image and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/thrift`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/thrift). This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fthrift).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/thrift/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/thrift/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What Is Thrift\n\n> The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.\n\nRead more about [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org).\n\n# How To Use This Image\n\nThis is image is intended to run as an executable. Files are provided by mounting a directory. Here's an example of compiling `service.thrift` to ruby to the current directory.\n\n```console\n$ docker run -v \"$PWD:/data\" thrift thrift -o /data --gen rb /data/service.thrift\n```\n\nNote, that you may want to include `-u $(id -u)` to set the UID on generated files. The thrift process runs as root by default which will generate root owned files depending on your docker setup.\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](http://www.apache.org/licenses/) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`thrift/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/thrift) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
