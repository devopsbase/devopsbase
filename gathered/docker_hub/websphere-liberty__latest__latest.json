This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fwebsphere-liberty).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/websphere-liberty/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/websphere-liberty/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# Overview\n\nThe images in this repository contain IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty for Developers and the IBM Java Runtime Environment. See the license section below for restrictions relating to the use of this image. For more information about WebSphere Application Server Liberty, see the [WASdev](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/category/getting-started/) site.\n\n# Images\n\nThere are multiple images available in this repository. The image with the tag `beta` contains the contents of the install archive for the latest monthly beta. The other images are all based on the latest generally available fix pack.\n\nThe `kernel` image contains just the Liberty kernel and no additional runtime features. This image can be used as the basis for custom built images that contain only the features required for a specific application. For example, the following Dockerfile starts with this image, copies in the `server.xml` that lists the features required by the application, and then uses the `installUtility` command to download those features from the online repository.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM websphere-liberty:kernel\nCOPY server.xml /config/\nRUN installUtility install --acceptLicense defaultServer\n```\n\nThe `webProfile6` image contains the features required for Java EE6 Web Profile compliance. It also pulls in additional features to bring the contents in to line with the features available for download by using the runtime JAR, most notably the features required for OSGi applications.\n\nThe `webProfile7` image contains the features required for Java EE7 Web Profile compliance. The `javaee7` image extends this image and adds the features required for Java EE7 Full Platform compliance. The `javaee7` image is also tagged with `latest`.\n\nThe `webProfile6`, `webProfile7` and `javaee7` images all also contain a common set of features that are expected to be of use for a typical production scenario. These features are: `appSecurity-2.0`, `collectiveMember-1.0`, `localConnector-1.0`, `ldapRegistry-3.0`, `monitor-1.0`, `requestTiming-1.0`, `restConnector-1.0`, `sessionDatabase-1.0`, `ssl-1.0`, and `webCache-1.0`.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe images are designed to support a number of different usage patterns. The following examples are based on the Java EE7 Liberty [application deployment sample](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/article_appdeployment/) and assume that [DefaultServletEngine.zip](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.servlet/releases/download/V1/DefaultServletEngine.zip) has been extracted to `/tmp` and the `server.xml` updated to accept HTTP connections from outside of the container by adding the following element inside the `server` stanza:\n\n```xml\n<httpEndpoint host=\"*\" httpPort=\"9080\" httpsPort=\"-1\"/>\n```\n\n1.\tEach image contains a default server configuration that specifies the corresponding features and exposes ports 9080 and 9443 for HTTP and HTTPS respectively. A .WAR file can therefore be mounted in the `dropins` directory of this server and run. The following example starts a container in the background running a .WAR file from the host file system with the HTTP and HTTPS ports mapped to 80 and 443 respectively.\n\n\t```console\n\t$ docker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 \\\n\t    -v /tmp/DefaultServletEngine/dropins/Sample1.war:/config/dropins/Sample1.war \\\n\t    websphere-liberty:webProfile7\n\t```\n\n\tWhen the server is started, you can browse to http://localhost/Sample1/SimpleServlet on the Docker host.\n\n\tNote: If you are using the boot2docker virtual machine on OS X or Windows, you need to get the IP of the virtual host by using the command `boot2docker ip` instead of by using localhost.\n\n2.\tFor greater flexibility over configuration, it is possible to mount an entire server configuration directory from the host and then specify the server name as a parameter to the run command. Note: This particular example server configuration provides only HTTP access.\n\n\t```console\n\t$ docker run -d -p 80:9080 \\\n\t  -v /tmp/DefaultServletEngine:/config \\\n\t  websphere-liberty:webProfile7\n\t```\n\n3.\tYou can also build an application layer on top of this image by using either the default server configuration or a new server configuration. In this example, we have copied the `Sample1.war` from `/tmp/DefaultServletEngine/dropins` to the same directory as the following Dockerfile.\n\n\t```dockerfile\n\tFROM websphere-liberty:webProfile7\n\tADD Sample1.war /config/dropins/\n\t```\n\n\tThis can then be built and run as follows:\n\n\t```console\n\t$ docker build -t app .\n\t$ docker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 app\n\t```\n\n4.\tYou can mount a data volume container that contains the application and the server configuration on to the image. This has the benefit that it has no dependency on files from the host but still allows the application container to be easily re-mounted on a newer version of the application server image. This example assumes that you have copied the `/tmp/DefaultServletEngine` directory in to the same directory as the Dockerfile.\n\n\tBuild and run the data volume container:\n\n\t```dockerfile\n\tFROM websphere-liberty:webProfile7\n\tADD DefaultServletEngine /config\n\t```\n\n\t```console\n\t$ docker build -t app-image .\n\t$ docker run -d -v /config \\\n\t    --name app app-image true\n\t```\n\n\tRun the WebSphere Liberty image with the volumes from the data volume container mounted:\n\n\t```console\n\t$ docker run -d -p 80:9080 \\\n\t  --volumes-from app websphere-liberty:webProfile7\n\t```\n\n# Using IBM JRE Class data sharing\n\nThe IBM JRE provides a feature [Class data sharing](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.lnx.80.doc/diag/understanding/shared_classes.html) which offers transparent and dynamic sharing of data between multiple Java Virtual Machines running on the same host by using shared memory backed by a file. When running the Liberty Docker image, it looks for the file at `/opt/ibm/wlp/output/.classCache`. To benefit from Class data sharing, this location needs to be shared between containers either through the host or a data volume container.\n\nTaking the application image from example 3 above, containers can share the host file location (containing the shared cache) `/tmp/websphere-liberty/classCache` as follows:\n\n```console\ndocker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 \\\n    -v /tmp/websphere-liberty/classCache:/opt/ibm/wlp/output/.classCache app\n```\n\nOr, create a named data volume container that exposes a volume at the location of the shared file:\n\n```console\ndocker run -e LICENSE=accept -v /opt/ibm/wlp/output/.classCache \\\n    --name classcache websphere-liberty true\n```\n\nThen, run the WebSphere Liberty image with the volumes from the data volume container classcache mounted as follows:\n\n```console\ndocker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 --volumes-from classcache app\n```\n\n# Running WebSphere Liberty in read-only mode\n\nLiberty writes to two different directories when running: `/opt/ibm/wlp/output` and `/logs`. In order to run the Liberty image in read-only mode these may be mounted as temporary file systems. If using the provided image, the keystore will be generated on initial start up in the server configuration. This means that the server configuration directory either needs to be read-write or the keystore will need to be built into the image. In the example command `/config` is mounted as a read-write volume.\n\n```console\ndocker run -d -p 80:9080 -p 443:9443 \\\n    --tmpfs /opt/ibm/wlp/output --tmpfs /logs -v /config --read-only \\\n    websphere-liberty:javaee7\n```\n\n# License\n\nThe Dockerfiles and associated scripts are licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\n\nLicenses for the products installed within the images are as follows:\n\n-\t[IBM JRE](http://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?la_formnum=&li_formnum=L-JWOD-9SYNCP&title=IBM%C2%AE+SDK%2C+Java+Technology+Edition%2C+Version+8.0&l=en) (International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs)\n-\t[IBM WebSphere Application Server](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/16.0.0.2/lafiles/runtime/en.html) in the non-beta images (International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs)\n-\t[IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Beta](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/beta/lafiles/en.html) in the `beta` image (International License Agreement for Early Release of Programs)\n\nNote: These licenses do not permit further distribution and that the terms for WebSphere Application Server in the non-beta images restrict usage to a developer machine or build server only, or subject to a maximum 2 gigabyte heap usage across all instances.
