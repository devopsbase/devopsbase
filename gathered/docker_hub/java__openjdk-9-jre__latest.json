This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fjava).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/java/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/java/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is Java?\n\nJava is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to allow application developers to \"write once, run anywhere\", meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.\n\nJava is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/01c12653951b2fe592c1f93a13b4e289ada0e3a1/java/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\n## Start a Java instance in your app\n\nThe most straightforward way to use this image is to use a Java container as both the build and runtime environment. In your `Dockerfile`, writing something along the lines of the following will compile and run your project:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM java:7\nCOPY . /usr/src/myapp\nWORKDIR /usr/src/myapp\nRUN javac Main.java\nCMD [\"java\", \"Main\"]\n```\n\nYou can then run and build the Docker image:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t my-java-app .\n$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-java-app\n```\n\n## Compile your app inside the Docker container\n\nThere may be occasions where it is not appropriate to run your app inside a container. To compile, but not run your app inside the Docker instance, you can write something like:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --rm -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp java:7 javac Main.java\n```\n\nThis will add your current directory as a volume to the container, set the working directory to the volume, and run the command `javac Main.java` which will tell Java to compile the code in `Main.java` and output the Java class file to `Main.class`.\n\n# Why is this only OpenJDK/OpenJRE?\n\nAs all of the major upstream Linux distributions are unwilling to redistribute Oracle Java in their own distribution channels, we have chosen to follow them. See references below on how each distribution does not distribute Oracle Java.\n\n-\tUbuntu stopped distributing it in the `sun-java6` package when Oracle retired the \"Operating System Distributor License for Java\" ([lists.ubuntu.com](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html)).\n-\tDebian requires users to download the Java tar manually from oracle.com and then use `java-package` to install it ([wiki.debian.net](https://wiki.debian.org/Java/Sun)).\n-\tThe webupd8 PPA for Ubuntu and Debian requires the user to accept the Oracle license in order for their software to download and install Oracle java ([webupd8.org](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html)).\n-\tGentoo has a *fetch-restriction* that requires the user to go to the Oracle website to download the Java tar manually which inclues accepting the license ([wiki.gentoo.org](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Java)).\n-\tCentOS requires users to go and download the rpm provided by Oracle at java.com and thus accept the Oracle license ([wiki.centos.org](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/JavaRuntimeEnvironment)).\n-\tRedHat provides instructions to add a repo that is maintained by Oracle ([access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/732883)).\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `java` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `java:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of [`buildpack-deps`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). `buildpack-deps` is designed for the average user of docker who has many images on their system. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages. This reduces the number of packages that images that derive from it need to install, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.\n\n## `java:alpine`\n\nThis image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.\n\nThis variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.\n\nTo minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/java/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/java/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`java/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/java) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
