  "readme": "# Squirrel Mac Server\n\nThe purpose of this project is to provide the server-side requirements of the [Squirrel.Mac](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac) auto-update system.  Note that this bears little-to-no relation to the [Squirrel.Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) framework, which doesn't require an active server.\n\nSquirrel.Mac is intended to be integrated with an application.  It facilitates the process of checking for, downloading and installing updates.\n\n## Update Process\n\nThe flow goes something like this:\n\n* An application initializes Squirrel.Mac, gives it a url to hit to check for updates\n* Squirrel requests this url\n    * If it gets a \"204 No Content\" response, it assumes no update is required and reports as much to the application\n    * Any other response is parsed as JSON, and the \"url\" field is extracted\n* If an update is required, squirrel downloads the given URL, unzips it, and does various prepatatory steps\n* Squirrel notifies the application an update is available\n* The application presumably asks for user confirmation, then asks Squirrel to apply the update and then restart the application.\n\n## Existing Server\n\nThere is an existing [Squirrel.Server](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Server), implemented in ruby.  It wasn't sufficient for our case for the following reasons:\n\n* It's inflexible, and only supports hosting updates for a single application\n* It would require us to modify our deployment strategy to include restarting the server\n\n## This Project\n\nThis server is dead simple.  It sends a 204 response as appropriate, but otherwise just proxies json files hosted elsewhere  It expects two parameters:\n\n* `url` - the json url to request\n* `version` (optional) - the version of the installed application\n\nThe server performs the following steps:\n\n* Requests the `url`\n* Parses the response as json (handling the various error cases)\n* Extracts the `version` field from the json response (which is actually ignored by Squrrel.Mac)\n* Compares that against the `version` query parameter\n    * If they match, send 204 No Content\n    * If not, send the data along\n\nThe server makes to attempt to do any caching, since load should be fairly low.\n",
