This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fgazebo).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/gazebo/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/gazebo/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is [Gazebo](http://www.gazebosim.org/)?\n\nRobot simulation is an essential tool in every roboticist's toolbox. A well-designed simulator makes it possible to rapidly test algorithms, design robots, and perform regression testing using realistic scenarios. Gazebo offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. At your fingertips is a robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces. Best of all, Gazebo is free with a vibrant community.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazebo_simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazebo_simulator)\n\n[![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/54c75ffef879ebb659bb82d5bc690bdb299c60c4/gazebo/logo.png)](http://www.gazebosim.org/)\n\n# How to use this image\n\n## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Gazebo project\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM gazebo:gzserver5\n# place here your application's setup specifics\nCMD [ \"gzserver\", \"my-gazebo-app-args\" ]\n```\n\nYou can then build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t my-gazebo-app .\n$ docker run -it -v=\"/tmp/.gazebo/:/root/.gazebo/\" --name my-running-app my-gazebo-app\n```\n\n## Deployment use cases\n\nThis dockerized image of Gazebo is intended to provide a simplified and consistent platform to build and deploy cloud based robotic simulations. Built from the [official Ubuntu image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) and Gazebo's official Debian packages, it includes recent supported releases for quick access and download. This provides roboticists in research and industry with an easy way to develop continuous integration and testing on training for autonomous actions and task planning, control dynamics and regions of stability, kinematic modeling and prototype characterization, localization and mapping algorithms, swarm behavior and networking, as well as general system integration and validation.\n\nConducting such complex simulations with high validity remains computationally demanding, and oftentimes outside the capacity of a modest local workstation. With the added complexity of the algorithms being benchmarked, we can soon exceed the capacity of even the most formidable servers. This is why a more distributed approach remains attractive for those who begin to encounter limitations of a centralized computing host. However, the added complication of building and maintaining a distributed testbed over a set of clusters has for a while required more time and effort than many smaller labs and businesses would have deemed appropriate to implement.\n\nWith the advancements and standardization of software containers, roboticists are primed to acquire a host of improved developer tooling for building and shipping software. To help alleviate the growing pains and technical challenges of adopting new practices, we have focused on providing an official resource for using Gazebo with these new technologies.\n\n## Deployment suggestions\n\nThe `gzserver` tags are designed to have a small footprint and simple configuration, thus only include required Gazebo dependencies. The standard messaging port `11345` is exposed to allow for client connections and messages API.\n\n### Volumes\n\nGazebo uses the `~/.gazebo/` directory for storing logs, models and scene info. If you wish to persist these files beyond the lifecycle of the containers which produced them, the `~/.gazebo/` folder can be mounted to an external volume on the host, or a derived image can specify volumes to be managed by the Docker engine. By default, the container runs as the `root` user, so `/root/.gazebo/` would be the full path to these files.\n\nFor example, if one wishes to use their own `.gazebo` folder that already resides in their local home directory, with a username of `ubuntu`, we can simple launch the container with an additional volume argument:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -v \"/home/ubuntu/.gazebo/:/root/.gazebo/\" gazebo\n```\n\nOne thing to be careful about is that gzserver logs to files named `/root/.gazebo/server-<port>/*.log`, where `<port>` is the port number that server is listening on (11345 by default). If you run and mount multiple containers using the same default port and same host side directory, then they will collide and attempt writing to the same file. If you want to run multiple gzservers on the same docker host, then a bit more clever volume mounting of `~/.gazebo/` subfolders would be required.\n\n### Devices\n\nAs of Gazebo version 5.0, physics simulation under a headless instances of gzserver works fine. However some application may require image rendering camera views and ray traces for other sensor modalities. For Gazebo, this requires a running X server for rendering and capturing scenes. In addition, graphical hardware acceleration is also needed for reasonable realtime framerates. To this extent, mounting additional graphic devices into the container and linking to a running X server is required. In the interest of maintaining a general purpose and minimalistic image which is not tightly coupled to host system software and hardware, we do not include tags here with these additional requirements and instructions. You can however use this repo to build and customize your own images to fit your software/hardware configuration. The OSRF's Docker Hub organization profile contains a Gazebo repo at [osrf/gazebo](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/osrf/gazebo/) which is based on this repo but includes additional tags for these advanced use cases.\n\n### Development\n\nIf you not only wish to run Gazebo, but develop for it too, i.e. compile custom plug-ins or build upon messaging interfaces for ROS, this will require the development package included in the `libgazebo` tag. If you simply need to run Gazebo as a headless server, then the `gzserver` tag consist of a smaller image size.\n\n## Deployment example\n\nIn this short example, we'll spin up a new container running gazebo server, connect to it using a local gazebo client, then spawn a double inverted pendulum and record the simulation for later playback.\n\n> First launch a gazebo server with a mounted volume for logging and name the container gazebo:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -d -v=\"/tmp/.gazebo/:/root/.gazebo/\" --name=gazebo gazebo\n```\n\n> Now open a new bash session in the container using the same entrypoint to configure the environment. Then download the double_pendulum model and load it into the simulation.\n\n```console\n$ docker exec -it gazebo bash\n$ curl -o double_pendulum.sdf http://models.gazebosim.org/double_pendulum_with_base/model-1_4.sdf\n$ gz model --model-name double_pendulum --spawn-file double_pendulum.sdf\n```\n\n> To start recording the running simulation, simply use [`gz log`](http://www.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=log_filtering&cat=tools_utilities) to do so.\n\n```console\n$ gz log --record 1\n```\n\n> After a few seconds, go ahead and stop recording by disabling the same flag.\n\n```console\n$ gz log --record 0\n```\n\n> To introspect our logged recording, we can navigate to log directory and use `gz log` to open and examine the motion and joint state of the pendulum. This will allow you to step through the poses of the pendulum links.\n\n```console\n$ cd ~/.gazebo/log/*/gzserver/\n$ gz log --step --hz 10 --filter *.pose/*.pose --file state.log\n```\n\n> If you have an equivalent release of Gazebo installed locally, you can connect to the gzserver inside the container using gzclient GUI by setting the address of the master URI to the containers public address.\n\n```console\n$ export GAZEBO_MASTER_IP=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' gazebo)\n$ export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=$GAZEBO_MASTER_IP:11345\n$ gzclient --verbose\n```\n\n> In the rendered OpenGL view with gzclient you should see the moving double pendulum created prior still oscillating. From here you can control or monitor state of the simulation using the graphical interface, add more pendulums, reset the world, make more logs, etc. To quit the simulation, close the gzclient window and stop the container.\n\n```console\n$ docker stop gazebo\n$ docker rm gazebo\n```\n\n> Even though our old gazebo container has been removed, we can still see that our record log has been preserved in the host volume directory.\n\n```console\n$ cd /tmp/.gazebo/log/\n$ ls\n```\n\n> Again, if you have an equivalent release of Gazebo installed on your host system, you can play back the simulation with gazebo by using the recorded log file.\n\n```console\n$ export GAZEBO_MASTER_IP=127.0.0.1\n$ export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=$GAZEBO_MASTER_IP:11345\n$ cd /tmp/.gazebo/log/*/gzserver/\n$ gazebo --verbose --play state.log\n```\n\n# More Resources\n\n[Gazebosim.org](http://www.gazebosim.org/): Main Gazebo website\n\n[Answers](http://answers.gazebosim.org/): Find answers and ask questions\n\n[Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/wiki): General information and tutorials\n\n[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/osrfoundation.org/d/forum/gazebo): Join for news and announcements\n\n[Simulation Models](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src): Robots, objects, and other simulation models\n\n[Blog](http://wiki.gazebosim.org/blog.html): Stay up-to-date\n\n[OSRF](http://www.osrfoundation.org/): Open Source Robotics Foundation\n\n# License\n\nGazebo is open-source licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/osrf/docker_images/issues).
