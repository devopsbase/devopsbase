  "readme": "# **DEPRECATED**\n\nThis image is officially deprecated as it has been abandoned by the original maintainer. This content will be removed from the Official Repositories program in the near future, so users will need to move to an alternative soon. A good place to look is the [`glassfish/server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/glassfish/server) repository on DockerHub, which is managed by an Oracle employee associated with the Glassfish project.\n\n# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links\n\n-\t[`4.0-jdk7`, `4.0` (*4.0-jdk7/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/aws/aws-eb-glassfish/blob/aafcfc5e812dfb9b998105d3ca9da1b7f10664e1/4.0-jdk7/Dockerfile)\n-\t[`4.1-jdk8`, `4.1`, `latest` (*4.1-jdk8/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/aws/aws-eb-glassfish/blob/aafcfc5e812dfb9b998105d3ca9da1b7f10664e1/4.1-jdk8/Dockerfile)\n\nFor more information about this image and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/glassfish`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/glassfish). This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fglassfish).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/glassfish/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/glassfish/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# GlassFish\n\nGlassFish is an open-source application server project started by Sun Microsystems for the Java EE platform and now sponsored by Oracle Corporation. The supported version is called Oracle GlassFish Server. GlassFish is free software, dual-licensed under two free software licences: the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) and the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the classpath exception.\n\nGlassFish is the reference implementation of Java EE and as such supports Enterprise JavaBeans, JPA, JavaServer Faces, JMS, RMI, JavaServer Pages, servlets, etc. This allows developers to create enterprise applications that are portable and scalable, and that integrate with legacy technologies. Optional components can also be installed for additional services.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish)\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.1.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`glassfish/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/glassfish) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-eb-glassfish/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-eb-glassfish/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.",
