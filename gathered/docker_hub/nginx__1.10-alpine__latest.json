This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fnginx).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/nginx/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/nginx/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is Nginx?\n\nNginx (pronounced \"engine-x\") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server). The nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage. It is licensed under the 2-clause BSD-like license and it runs on Linux, BSD variants, Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, as well as on other *nix flavors. It also has a proof of concept port for Microsoft Windows.\n\n> [wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/01c12653951b2fe592c1f93a13b4e289ada0e3a1/nginx/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\n## hosting some simple static content\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-nginx -v /some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx\n```\n\nAlternatively, a simple `Dockerfile` can be used to generate a new image that includes the necessary content (which is a much cleaner solution than the bind mount above):\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM nginx\nCOPY static-html-directory /usr/share/nginx/html\n```\n\nPlace this file in the same directory as your directory of content (\"static-html-directory\"), run `docker build -t some-content-nginx .`, then start your container:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-nginx -d some-content-nginx\n```\n\n## exposing the port\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-nginx -d -p 8080:80 some-content-nginx\n```\n\nThen you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.\n\n## complex configuration\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-nginx -v /some/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -d nginx\n```\n\nFor information on the syntax of the Nginx configuration files, see [the official documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/) (specifically the [Beginner's Guide](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure)).\n\nBe sure to include `daemon off;` in your custom configuration to ensure that Nginx stays in the foreground so that Docker can track the process properly (otherwise your container will stop immediately after starting)!\n\nIf you wish to adapt the default configuration, use something like the following to copy it from a running Nginx container:\n\n```console\n$ docker cp some-nginx:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf /some/nginx.conf\n```\n\nAs above, this can also be accomplished more cleanly using a simple `Dockerfile`:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM nginx\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n\nThen, build with `docker build -t some-custom-nginx .` and run:\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name some-nginx -d some-custom-nginx\n```\n\n### using environment variables in nginx configuration\n\nOut-of-the-box, Nginx doesn't support using environment variables inside most configuration blocks. But `envsubst` may be used as a workaround if you need to generate your nginx configuration dynamically before nginx starts.\n\nHere is an example using docker-compose.yml:\n\n```web:\n  image: nginx\n  volumes:\n   - ./mysite.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/mysite.template\n  ports:\n   - \"8080:80\"\n  environment:\n   - NGINX_HOST=foobar.com\n   - NGINX_PORT=80\n  command: /bin/bash -c \"envsubst < /etc/nginx/conf.d/mysite.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'\"\n```\n\nThe `mysite.template` file may then contain variable references like this :\n\n`listen       ${NGINX_PORT};\n`\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `nginx` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `nginx:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.\n\n## `nginx:alpine`\n\nThis image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.\n\nThis variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.\n\nTo minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`nginx/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/nginx) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
