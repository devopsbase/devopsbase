The image is built based on [Python 3.4.3](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/).\n\n# How to use this image?\nThe docker image is auto built at [https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/yeasy/mongo-connector/](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/yeasy/mongo-connector/).\n\n\n## In Dockerfile\n```sh\nFROM yeasy/mongo-connector:latest\n```\n\n## Local Run\nBy default, it will connect mongo node (`$MONGO` or the mongo host, on port `$MONGOPORT` or 27017) and elasticsearch node (`$ELASTICSEARCH` or the elasticsearch host, on port $ELASTICPORT or 9200).\n\nBoot two containers with name mongo (config to cluster) and elasticsearch.\n```sh\n$ docker run -d --link=mongo:mongo --link=elasticsearch:elasticsearch yeasy/mongo-connector\n```\n\nIt will connect the two containers together to sync data between each other.\n\n# Which image is based on?\nThe image is based on official `python:3.4.3`.\n\n# What has been changed?\n\n## Config TZ\nConfig timezone to Asia/Shanghai.\n\n\n# Install mongo-connector\nInstall the mongo-connector:2.1.\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.7.1.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.0) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\n# User Feedback\n## Documentation\nBe sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md`](https://github.com/yeasy/docker-mongo-connector/blob/master/README.md) file before attempting a pull request.\n\n## Issues\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/yeasy/docker-mongo-connector/issues).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the email.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/yeasy/docker-mongo-connector/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n",
