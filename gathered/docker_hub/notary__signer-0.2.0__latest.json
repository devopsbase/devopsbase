This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fnotary).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/notary/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/notary/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# How to use this repository\n\nThe Notary respository contains two distinct applications, Notary Server, and Notary Signer. The images for these applications are tagged \"server-\\*\" and \"signer-\\*\" respectively. While the server can be configured to run entirely in memory, this configuration is not be appropriate for a production deployment so you should expect to run both a server *and* and signer.\n\nEnsure that the images you are running have similar version tags. That is, if you are running the server-0.2.0 tag, you should also be running the similar signer-0.2.0 tag. Running different versions of the server and signer will never be a supported configuration.\n\n# Notary Server\n\nThe Notary server manages JSON formatted TUF (The Update Framework) metadata for Notary clients and the docker command line tool's Docker Content Trust features. It requires a companion Notary signer instance and a MySQL (or MariaDB) database.\n\n## How to use this image\n\nThe following sample configuration is included in the image:\n\n\t{\n\t    \"server\": {\n\t        \"http_addr\": \":4443\",\n\t        \"tls_key_file\": \"/certs/notary-server.key\",\n\t        \"tls_cert_file\": \"/certs/notary-server.crt\"\n\t    },\n\t    \"trust_service\": {\n\t      \"type\": \"remote\",\n\t      \"hostname\": \"notarysigner\",\n\t      \"port\": \"7899\",\n\t      \"tls_ca_file\": \"/certs/root-ca.crt\",\n\t      \"key_algorithm\": \"ecdsa\",\n\t      \"tls_client_cert\": \"/certs/notary-server.crt\",\n\t      \"tls_client_key\": \"/certs/notary-server.key\"\n\t    },\n\t    \"logging\": {\n\t        \"level\": \"info\"\n\t    },\n\t    \"storage\": {\n\t        \"backend\": \"mysql\",\n\t        \"db_url\": \"server@tcp(mysql:3306)/notaryserver?parseTime=True\"\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nThe components you *must* provide are the certificates and keys, and the links for the `notarysigner` and `mysql` hostnames. The `root-ca.crt` file enables the Notary server to identify valid signers, which it communicates with over mutual TLS using a GRPC interface. The `notary-server.crt` and`notary-server.key` are used to identify this service to both external clients, and signer instances. All the certificate and key files must be readable by the notary user which is created inside the container and owns the notary-server process.\n\nIf you require a different configuration, you should wrap this image with your own Dockerfile.\n\nFor more details on how to configure your Notary server, please read the [docs](https://github.com/docker/notary/blob/master/docs/reference/server-config.md).\n\n# Notary Signer\n\nThe Notary signer is a support service for the Notary server. It manages private keys and performs all signing operations. It requires a MySQL (or MariaDB) database.\n\n## How to use this image\n\nThe following sample configuration is included in the image:\n\n\t{\n\t    \"server\": {\n\t        \"http_addr\": \":4444\",\n\t        \"grpc_addr\": \":7899\",\n\t        \"tls_cert_file\": \"/certs/notary-signer.crt\",\n\t        \"tls_key_file\": \"/certs/notary-signer.key\",\n\t        \"client_ca_file\": \"/certs/notary-server.crt\"\n\t    },\n\t    \"logging\": {\n\t        \"level\": \"info\"\n\t    },\n\t    \"storage\": {\n\t        \"backend\": \"mysql\",\n\t        \"db_url\": \"signer@tcp(mysql:3306)/notarysigner?parseTime=True\"\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nThe components you *must* provide are the certificates and keys, and the link for the `mysql` hostname. The `notary-server.crt` file enables the Notary signer to identify valid servers, which it communicates with over mutual TLS using a GRPC interface. The `notary-server.crt` and`notary-server.key` are used to identify this service to both external clients, and signer instances. All the certificate and key files must be readable by the notary user which is created inside the container and owns the notary-signer process.\n\nIf you require a different configuration, you should wrap this image with your own Dockerfile.\n\nFor more details on how to configure your Notary signer, please read the [docs](https://github.com/docker/notary/blob/master/docs/reference/signer-config.md).\n\n## Database Migrations\n\nNotary server and signer both use the [migrate tool](https://github.com/mattes/migrate) to manage database updates. The migration files can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/notary/tree/master/migrations/) and are an ordered list of plain SQL files. The migrate tool manages schema versions to ensure that migrations start and end at the correct point.\n\nWe strongly recommend you create separate databases and users with restricted permissions such that the server cannot access the signer's database and vice versa.\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](https://github.com/docker/notary/blob/master/LICENSE) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/notary-official-images/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker/notary-official-images/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`notary/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/notary) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
