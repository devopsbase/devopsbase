This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Firssi).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/irssi/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/irssi/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is irssi?\n\nIrssi is a terminal based IRC client for UNIX systems. It also supports SILC and ICB protocols via plugins. Some people refer to it as 'the client of the future'.\n\n> [irssi.org](http://irssi.org)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/633afc6f794a31463888319d9f0c3cc0801d81e3/irssi/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\nBecause it is unlikely any two irssi users have the same configuration preferences, this image does not include an irssi configuration. To configure irssi to your liking, please refer to [upstream's excellent (and comprehensive) +documentation](http://irssi.org/documentation).\n\nBe sure to also checkout the [awesome scripts](https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org) you can download to customize your irssi configuration.\n\n## Directly via bind mount\n\nOn a Linux system, build and launch a container named `my-running-irssi` like this:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -it --name my-running-irssi -e TERM -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \\\n    --log-driver=none \\\n    -v $HOME/.irssi:/home/user/.irssi:ro \\\n    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \\\n    irssi\n```\n\nWe specify `--log-driver=none` to avoid storing useless interactive terminal data.\n\nOn a Mac OS X system, run the same image using:\n\n```console\n$ docker run -it --name my-running-irssi -e TERM -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \\\n    --log-driver=none \\\n    -v $HOME/.irssi:/home/user/.irssi:ro \\\n    irssi\n```\n\nYou omit `/etc/localtime` on Mac OS X because `boot2docker` doesn't use this file.\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `irssi` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `irssi:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of.\n\n## `irssi:alpine`\n\nThis image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.\n\nThis variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.\n\nTo minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](https://github.com/irssi/irssi/blob/master/COPYING) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jessfraz/irssi/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jessfraz/irssi/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`irssi/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/irssi) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
