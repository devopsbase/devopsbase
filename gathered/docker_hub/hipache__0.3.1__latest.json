  "readme": "# **DEPRECATED**\n\nThis image is officially deprecated due to upstream inactivity (last updated Feb 2015, [2d36766](https://github.com/hipache/hipache/commit/2d3676638f8b4b1758d70a8dffde1bef88eacf32); last release Apr 2014, [0.3.1](https://github.com/hipache/hipache/releases/tag/0.3.1)).\n\nThe following is a list of other HTTP proxies which might be suitable replacements depending on your needs:\n\n-\t[`mailgun/vulcand`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailgun/vulcand/)\n-\t[`traefik`](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/)\n-\t[`nginx`](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)\n-\t[`haproxy`](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy/)\n-\t[`httpd`](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/)\n\n# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links\n\n-\t[`latest`, `0.3.1` (*Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache/blob/c2d4864a663d976ff2560493fe8e0dd424b792b3/Dockerfile)\n\nFor more information about this image and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/hipache`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/hipache). This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fhipache).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/hipache/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/hipache/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is Hipache?\n\n**Hipache** (pronounced `hɪ'pætʃɪ`) is a distributed proxy designed to route high volumes of http and websocket traffic to unusually large numbers of virtual hosts, in a highly dynamic topology where backends are added and removed several times per second. It is particularly well-suited for PaaS (platform-as-a-service) and other environments that are both business-critical and multi-tenant.\n\nHipache was originally developed at [dotCloud](http://www.dotcloud.com), a popular platform-as-a-service, to replace its first-generation routing layer based on a heavily instrumented nginx deployment. It currently serves production traffic for tens of thousands of applications hosted on dotCloud. Hipache is based on the node-http-proxy library.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`hipache/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/hipache) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
