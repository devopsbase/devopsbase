This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fiojs).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/iojs/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/iojs/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n## What is io.js?\n\nio.js is a JavaScript platform built on Chrome's V8 runtime. This project began as a fork of Joyent's Node.jsâ„¢ and is compatible with the npm ecosystem.\n\nWhy? io.js aims to provide faster and predictable release cycles. It currently merges in the latest language, API and performance improvements to V8 while also updating libuv and other base libraries.\n\nThis project aims to continue development of io.js under an \"open governance model\" as opposed to corporate stewardship.\n\n> [iojs.org/faq.html](https://iojs.org/faq.html)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/935af30d59b926af599eb7405ef2988b31280179/iojs/logo.png)\n\n# How to use this image\n\nIf you want to distribute your application on the docker registry, create a `Dockerfile` in the root of application directory:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM iojs:onbuild\n\n# Expose the ports that your app uses. For example:\nEXPOSE 8080\n```\n\nThen simply run:\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t iojs-app\n...\n$ docker run --rm -it iojs-app\n```\n\nTo run a single script, you can mount it in a volume under `/usr/src/app`. From the root of your application directory (assuming your script is named `index.js`):\n\n```console\n$ docker run -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app -it --rm iojs iojs index.js\n```\n\n# Image Variants\n\nThe `iojs` images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.\n\n## `iojs:<version>`\n\nThis is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of [`buildpack-deps`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). `buildpack-deps` is designed for the average user of docker who has many images on their system. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages. This reduces the number of packages that images that derive from it need to install, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system.\n\n## `iojs:onbuild`\n\nThis image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating a `Dockerfile` in the base of your project directory with the line `FROM iojs:onbuild` will be enough to create a stand-alone image for your project.\n\nWhile the `onbuild` variant is really useful for \"getting off the ground running\" (zero to Dockerized in a short period of time), it's not recommended for long-term usage within a project due to the lack of control over *when* the `ONBUILD` triggers fire (see also [`docker/docker#5714`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5714), [`docker/docker#8240`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8240), [`docker/docker#11917`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/11917)).\n\nOnce you've got a handle on how your project functions within Docker, you'll probably want to adjust your `Dockerfile` to inherit from a non-`onbuild` variant and copy the commands from the `onbuild` variant `Dockerfile` (moving the `ONBUILD` lines to the end and removing the `ONBUILD` keywords) into your own file so that you have tighter control over them and more transparency for yourself and others looking at your `Dockerfile` as to what it does. This also makes it easier to add additional requirements as time goes on (such as installing more packages before performing the previously-`ONBUILD` steps).\n\n## `iojs:slim`\n\nThis image does not contain the common packages contained in the default tag and only contains the minimal packages needed to run `iojs`. Unless you are working in an environment where *only* the iojs image will be deployed and you have space constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this repository.\n\n# License\n\nView [license information](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/master/LICENSE) for the software contained in this image.\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-iojs/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-iojs/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`iojs/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/iojs) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
