This image is updated via [pull requests to the `docker-library/official-images` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pulls?q=label%3Alibrary%2Fcouchdb).\n\nFor detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/couchdb/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/couchdb/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).\n\n# What is Apache CouchDB?\n\nCouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with JSON documents. Access your documents and query your indexes with your web browser, via HTTP. Index, combine, and transform your documents with JavaScript. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can even serve web apps directly out of CouchDB. And you can distribute your data, or your apps, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s incremental replication. CouchDB supports master-master setups with automatic conflict detection.\n\nCouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on-the-fly document transformation and real-time change notifications, that makes web app development a breeze. It even comes with an easy to use web administration console. You guessed it, served up directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot about distributed scaling. CouchDB is highly available and partition tolerant, but is also eventually consistent. And we care a lot about your data. CouchDB has a fault-tolerant storage engine that puts the safety of your data first.\n\n> [couchdb.apache.org](https://couchdb.apache.org)\n\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/docs/2307451281c6b47b85abb3af9f0097e51c70a5be/couchdb/logo.png)\n\n## How to use this image\n\n### Start a CouchDB instance\n\n```console\n$ docker run -d --name my-couchdb couchdb\n```\n\nThis image includes `EXPOSE 5984` (the CouchDB port), so standard container linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers.\n\n### Using the instance\n\nIn order to use the running instance from an application, link the container\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name my-couchdb-app --link my-couchdb:couch couchdb\n```\n\nSee the [official docs](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/) for infomation on using and configuring CouchDB.\n\n### Exposing the port to the outside world\n\nIf you want to expose the port to the outside world, run\n\n```console\n$ docker run -p 5984:5984 -d couchdb\n```\n\nCouchDB listens on port 5984 for requests and the image includes `EXPOSE 5984`. The flag `-p 5984:5984` exposes this port on the host.\n\n## Persistent Data\n\nThere are several ways to store data used by applications that run in Docker containers. We encourage users of the `couchdb` images to familiarize themselves with the options available, including:\n\n-\tLet Docker manage the storage of your database data [by writing the database files to disk on the host system using its own internal volume management](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#adding-a-data-volume). This is the default and is easy and fairly transparent to the user. The downside is that the files may be hard to locate for tools and applications that run directly on the host system, i.e. outside containers.\n-\tCreate a data directory on the host system (outside the container) and [mount this to a directory visible from inside the container](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume). This places the database files in a known location on the host system, and makes it easy for tools and applications on the host system to access the files. The downside is that the user needs to make sure that the directory exists, and that e.g. directory permissions and other security mechanisms on the host system are set up correctly.\n\nCouchDB uses `/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb` to store its data. This directory is marked as a docker volume.\n\n### Using host directories\n\nYou can map the container's volumes to a directory on the host, so that the data is kept between runs of the container. This example uses your current directory, but that is in general not the correct place to store your persistent data!\n\n```console\n$ docker run -d -v $(pwd):/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb --name my-couchdb couchdb\n```\n\n## Specifying the admin user in the environment\n\nYou can use the two environment variables `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` to set up the admin user.\n\n```console\n$ docker run -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password -d couchdb\n```\n\n## Using your own CouchDB configuration file\n\nThe CouchDB configuration is specified in `.ini` files in `/usr/local/etc/couchdb`. Take a look at the [CouchDB configuration documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/config/index.html) to learn more about CouchDBs configuration structure.\n\nIf you want to use a customized CouchDB configuration, you can create your configuration file in a directory on the host machine and then mount that directory as `/usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.d` inside the `couchdb` container.\n\n```console\n$ docker run --name my-couchdb -v /my/custom-config-dir:/usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.d -d couchdb\n```\n\nYou can also use `couchdb` as the base image for your own couchdb instance and provie your own version of the `local.ini` config file:\n\nExample Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM couchdb\n\nCOPY local.ini /usr/local/etc/couchdb/\n```\n\nand then build and run\n\n```console\n$ docker build -t you/awesome-couchdb .\n$ docker run -d -p 5984:5984 you/awesome-couchdb\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nBy default containers run from this image only log to `stdout`. This means that the `/_log` endpoint is not available. You can enable logging to file in the [configuration](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/config/logging.html).\n\nFor example in `local.ini`:\n\n```ini\n[log]\nfile = /usr/local/var/log/couchdb/couch.log\n```\n\n## Erlang Version\n\nThis image uses Erlang `17.3` from Debian Jessie's repository. Debian's version patches a critical bug in Erlang `17.3` and is good to use with CouchDB ([confirmed by Jan Lehnardt](https://github.com/klaemo/docker-couchdb/issues/50#issuecomment-190832786)).\n\n# License\n\nApache CouchDB is licensed under the [Apache License](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n# Supported Docker versions\n\nThis image is officially supported on Docker version 1.12.2.\n\nSupport for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.\n\nPlease see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.\n\n# User Feedback\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you have any problems with or questions about this image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/klaemo/docker-couchdb/issues). If the issue is related to a CVE, please check for [a `cve-tracker` issue on the `official-images` repository first](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/issues?q=label%3Acve-tracker).\n\nYou can also reach many of the official image maintainers via the `#docker-library` IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.\n\nBefore you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/klaemo/docker-couchdb/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for this image is stored in the [`couchdb/` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/couchdb) of the [`docker-library/docs` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/docs). Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [repository's `README.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/README.md) before attempting a pull request.",
